# Module 7 · Forms & Authentication Plan

## Vision

Deliver a project-based journey that upgrades TaskFlow Pro forms, introduces
robust validation, and ships secure authentication flows.

## Outcomes

-  Form UX improvements measured by 20% reduction in abandon rate.
-  Auth conversions tracked via analytics dashboard.
-  Security requirements (TLS, session rotation, audit) documented and
   implemented.

## Lesson Outline

1. Introduction to forms and UX baselines.
2. Forms in React: controlled vs uncontrolled patterns.
3. React Hook Form basics and schema setup.
4. Advanced validation with Zod.
5. Dynamic form patterns with field arrays and conditional sections.
6. Form UX best practices (error messaging, accessibility).
7. Authentication foundations (flows, security, architecture, UX).
8. Auth service, session storage, and shared context.
9. Login implementation with analytics instrumentation.
10.   Password reset flow.
11.   Auth rollout, invites, and validation plan.

## Milestones

-  **Milestone A:** Complete forms lessons (1–6) and demo improved task creation
   form.
-  **Milestone B:** Ship authentication foundation (lessons 7–8) with staging
   toggles.
-  **Milestone C:** Finalize user-facing flows (lessons 9–11) and pass
   validation checklist.

## Dependencies

-  Backend endpoints for `/login`, `/logout`, `/refresh`, `/invite`, and
   `/reset`.
-  Analytics pipeline with event tracking for `login_success`, `login_error`,
   `reset_request`.
-  Design team assets for auth screens.

## Risks

-  Token storage decisions must align with security policy.
-  Form performance regression if field arrays mishandled.
-  Need feature flags to roll out authentication changes safely.

## Validation Strategy

-  Automated tests: unit (Zod schemas), integration (AuthService), e2e (Cypress
   auth suite).
-  Manual QA: run matrix defined in Lesson 15.
-  Observability: monitor login error rate and latency in Grafana.
