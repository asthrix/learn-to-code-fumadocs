# Module X · Extended Plan

## Vision

Provide a guided path for advanced learners to polish TaskFlow Pro beyond the
core curriculum, focusing on UX enhancements, data reliability, and operational
excellence.

## Outcomes

-  Drag-and-drop and command palette elevate productivity UX.
-  React Query adoption delivers optimistic updates and cache control.
-  Multi-user features (profiles, listings, reviews) demonstrate production
   readiness.
-  Cypress regression suite and validation checklist safeguard advanced work.

## Lesson Outline

1. Introduction to optional enhancements, prioritization, and success metrics.
2. Forms and inputs refinement with headless primitives, shortcuts, and
   autosave.
3. React Query implementation for caching, optimistic updates, and prefetch.
4. Users & profiles with avatar uploads and role-based access control.
5. Listing creation wizard with draft persistence and publishing workflow.
6. Reviews feature with moderation heuristics and analytics.
7. Cypress testing strategy with page objects, stubbing, and CI integration.
8. React 19 readiness note covering dependencies and migration plan.
9. Conclusion summarizing outcomes, portfolio prep, and maintenance cadence.
10.   Validation checklist for advanced features and rollback readiness.

## Milestones

-  **Milestone A:** UX improvements (forms, DnD, command palette) prototyped
   with metrics defined.
-  **Milestone B:** Data enhancements (React Query, profiles, listings) deployed
   behind feature flags.
-  **Milestone C:** Reviews, moderation, and analytics surfaced with dashboards
   updated.
-  **Milestone D:** Cypress suite automated, documentation complete, validation
   checklist signed off.

## Dependencies

-  Access to backend endpoints for listings, reviews, and profiles.
-  Feature flag infrastructure for gradual rollout of experimental features.
-  QA environment with Cypress runners and storage for artifacts.

## Risks

-  Scope creep overwhelming learners—mitigated by prioritization matrix.
-  Increased API surface area without adequate monitoring.
-  New features complicating existing state management if not fully migrated to
   React Query.

## Validation Strategy

-  Cypress regression suite covering advanced flows.
-  Automated lint/type/test gates for each PR.
-  Manual sign-off matrix tied to validation checklist.
-  Release retrospectives capturing learnings and next steps.
