# Module 8 Â· Deployment Plan

## Vision

Deliver a repeatable deployment pipeline that takes TaskFlow Pro from production
build to validated release with confidence.

## Outcomes

-  Automated production builds with bundle analysis accessible to the team.
-  Vercel project configured with preview + production environments.
-  Governance checklist ensuring every release has monitoring, rollback, and QA
   coverage.
-  Post-release validation process documented for future cohorts.

## Lesson Outline

1. Production build optimization and environment variable catalog.
2. Vercel deployment workflow from repository linking to promotion.
3. Deployment best practices: monitoring, rollbacks, governance.
4. Deployment validation: smoke tests, manual QA, post-release checks.

## Milestones

-  **Milestone A:** Production build completes with analyzer report and env var
   documentation.
-  **Milestone B:** Vercel previews integrated with notifications; first
   production promotion rehearsed.
-  **Milestone C:** Best-practice guardrails defined (monitoring, rollback,
   governance).
-  **Milestone D:** Full validation run executed and logged in release journal.

## Dependencies

-  Access to Vercel project with required environment variables.
-  Analytics and error tracking accounts (Sentry, feature flag service).
-  QA resources for manual validation.

## Risks

-  Missing environment variables causing runtime failures.
-  Insufficient monitoring leading to delayed incident response.
-  Rollback procedure untested before critical release.

## Validation Strategy

-  CI pipeline (lint/test/build) gates merges.
-  Bundle analyzer metrics tracked release over release.
-  Preview smoke tests executed automatically via GitHub Actions.
-  Post-deploy checks recorded in release journal with owner sign-off.
