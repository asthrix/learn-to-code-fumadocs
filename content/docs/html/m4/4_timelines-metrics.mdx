# Timelines & Milestones

## Learning Objectives

Chronological storytelling demonstrates sustained impact. Semantic timelines
help readers‚Äîand search engines‚Äîfollow Avery's growth without confusion.

## Timeline Pattern

```html
<ol class="experience-timeline">
   <li>
      <article aria-labelledby="timeline-2024">
         <header>
            <h3 id="timeline-2024">
               <time datetime="2024">2024</time> ¬∑ Portfolio Pulse relaunch
            </h3>
            <p>Shipped end-to-end UX audit and conversion uplift roadmap.</p>
         </header>
         <p class="metric">Conversion rate +32% within 6 weeks.</p>
         <footer>
            <a
               href="/case-studies/fintech-onboarding.html"
               data-cta="timeline-2024"
            >
               View case study
            </a>
         </footer>
      </article>
   </li>
   <li>
      <article aria-labelledby="timeline-2023">
         <header>
            <h3 id="timeline-2023">
               <time datetime="2023">2023</time> ¬∑ Lead Service Designer,
               FluxHealth
            </h3>
            <p>Built an in-house design system adopted by 6 product teams.</p>
         </header>
         <p class="metric">Support tickets dropped 45% post rollout.</p>
      </article>
   </li>
</ol>
```

Use `<article>` to encapsulate entries, making them shareable snippets.

## Enhancements

-  Add `<data>` or `<meter>` to highlight numeric progress within entries.
-  Incorporate inline quotes using `<blockquote>` when testimonials align with a
   milestone.
-  Support vertical rhythm with CSS rather than extra markup.

Document timeline guidelines in `docs/layout.shared.md` and update
`notes/module-4-plan.md` with content decisions.

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Use Ordered Lists

**Why:** Communicates chronology and allows assistive tech to announce position.

### 2. Provide Machine-Readable Dates

**Why:** `<time datetime>` improves search and automation.

---

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Styling Headings as Dates Without `<time>`

**Problem:** Loses semantic value.

**Fix:** Wrap visible date in `<time>` even if styled heavily.

### 2. Reversing Order Without Context

**Problem:** Readers expecting chronological order get confused.

**Fix:** If using reverse order, add copy like "Newest first" and maintain
`<ol>`.

## üîç Portfolio Pulse Action Items

1. Draft timeline entries for at least three milestones using the pattern above.
2. Associate each entry with relevant metrics or testimonials from the data
   inventory.
3. Update `docs/data-sources.md` with references used in the timeline.
4. Capture analytics IDs and CTA links in `docs/state-architecture.md`.

---

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

-  [ ] Timeline uses `<ol>` with `<time>` in each heading.
-  [ ] Entries link back to supporting case studies where relevant.
-  [ ] Documentation updated with data references and analytics IDs.
-  [ ] Screen reader announcement order verified.
