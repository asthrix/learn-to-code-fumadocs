# Module 4 · Data Presentation & Credibility

Module 4 turns qualitative wins into quantifiable proof. You will present
metrics, milestones, and testimonials with semantic HTML that hiring managers
and recruiters trust.

### What You Will Deliver

-  A data spotlight section with tables, definition lists, and highlight cards.
-  An experience timeline using `<time>` and accessible ordering.
-  Testimonials and endorsements with proper citation and consent notes.
-  Documentation covering data sources, refresh cadence, and analytics hooks.

### Lesson Map

1. **Data Storytelling** — align credibility goals with reliable data sources.
2. **Semantic Tables** — present comparative metrics with captions and
   summaries.
3. **Definition Lists** — structure key-value insights and service packages.
4. **Timelines & Metrics** — showcase milestones using `<time>`, `<ol>`, and
   supporting semantics.
5. **Testimonials & Social Proof** — mark up quotes, citations, and logos
   ethically.
6. **Structured Highlights** — use `<data>`, `<meter>`, and highlight patterns
   to reinforce outcomes.
7. **Credibility Blueprint** — document section architecture, metadata, and CTA
   strategy.
8. **Implementation** — build the credibility layer into Portfolio Pulse.
9. **Validation** — audit accessibility, accuracy, and documentation.

Keep your project brief, validation log, and analytics notes close. You will add
new sections for data governance and testimonial approvals.
