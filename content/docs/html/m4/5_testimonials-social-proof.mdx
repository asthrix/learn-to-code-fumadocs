# Testimonials & Social Proof

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Present quotes with proper attribution and consent notes.
-  [ ] Integrate optional headshots or logos without harming accessibility.
-  [ ] Update documentation for testimonial refresh cadence.

## Why It Matters

Testimonials are powerful‚Äîbut only when they are trustworthy. Semantic markup
and governance keep praise credible and compliant with privacy agreements.

## Testimonial Pattern

```html
<figure class="testimonial" aria-labelledby="testimonial-jamie">
   <blockquote>
      <p>
         "Avery translated complex research into actionable strategy within two
         weeks, unlocking a 6-month roadmap our team fully embraced."
      </p>
   </blockquote>
   <figcaption id="testimonial-jamie">
      <div class="attribution">
         <img
            src="/images/headshots/jamie-taylor.jpg"
            alt="Portrait of Jamie Taylor"
            width="80"
            height="80"
            loading="lazy"
         />
         <p>
            <span class="name">Jamie Taylor</span>
            <span class="role">VP of Product, FluxHealth</span>
         </p>
      </div>
      <cite>Excerpt from 2025 partnership retrospective</cite>
   </figcaption>
</figure>
```

### Accessibility Notes

-  Provide `alt` text for headshots describing the person, not the photo style.
-  Use `<cite>` for the source (report, talk, interview).
-  Include consent metadata in `docs/testimonial-consent.md` with approval date.

## Logo or Badge Wall

Use lists to present client logos with accessible text.

```html
<ul class="logo-list">
   <li>
      <img
         src="/logos/fluxhealth.svg"
         alt="FluxHealth"
         width="120"
         height="40"
      />
   </li>
   <li>
      <img src="/logos/northbank.svg" alt="Northbank" width="120" height="40" />
   </li>
</ul>
```

Avoid using logos without permission; document agreements in the consent file.

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Rotate Testimonials Periodically

**Why:** Keeps content fresh and accurate.

Set a reminder in `docs/data-sources.md` with `refresh_cadence` entries.

### 2. Provide Text Alternatives for Logos

**Why:** Logos alone are meaningless to screen readers.

Use `alt` text with the brand name or descriptive label.

---

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Using `<q>` for Multi-Sentence Quotes

**Problem:** Inline quotes break semantics.

**Fix:** Use `<blockquote>` with `<p>` elements inside.

### 2. Forgetting Consent Logs

**Problem:** Testimonials may be retracted or time-bound.

**Fix:** Track consent status, expiration, and contact info in the consent doc.

---

## üîç Portfolio Pulse Action Items

1. Draft testimonial markup with attribution, headshot (optional), and citation.
2. Build a logo wall or alternative social proof pattern approved by Avery.
3. Create/update `docs/testimonial-consent.md` with permissions and expiry
   dates.
4. Log analytics hooks (e.g., `data-cta="testimonial-contact"`) in
   `docs/state-architecture.md`.

---

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

-  [ ] Testimonials use `<blockquote>` and `<cite>` with accurate attribution.
-  [ ] Headshots and logos include descriptive `alt` text.
-  [ ] Consent documentation updated with approval dates.
-  [ ] Component tested for keyboard and screen reader navigation.
