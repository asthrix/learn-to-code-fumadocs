# Module 4 Validation

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Confirm metrics, testimonials, and milestones are accurate and approved.
-  [ ] Validate accessibility and responsive behavior across devices.
-  [ ] Update documentation and retro notes for ongoing governance.

## Why It Matters

Data credibility erodes quickly if numbers are wrong or contexts missing. A
rigorous validation step protects trust before you move into Module 5's advanced
polish.

---

## Validation Workflow

### 1. Data Accuracy

-  Reconcile metrics against `docs/data-sources.md`; confirm latest values.
-  Verify testimonial consent dates in `docs/testimonial-consent.md`.
-  Check timeline entries against `notes/module-4-plan.md` and retro logs.

### 2. Accessibility Audits

-  Run Lighthouse Accessibility (target ‚â• 95).
-  Use axe DevTools to inspect table headers, timeline order, and testimonial
   structure.
-  Navigate section with keyboard and screen reader, ensuring logical focus
   order and announcements.

### 3. Responsive & Performance

-  Test on desktop (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and mobile (iOS Safari, Android
   Chrome).
-  Throttle network to `Fast 3G` to observe lazy loading or heavy assets.
-  Record Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) impact in `docs/validation-log.md`.

### 4. Documentation

-  Update `docs/layout.shared.md` and `docs/state-architecture.md` with final
   implementation notes.
-  Capture Module 4 retro insights in `notes/module-4-retro.md` (create if
   needed).

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Cross-Check Copy and Data

**Why:** Minor typos can undermine trust.

Pair with Avery to confirm the story matches the data.

### 2. Set Review Reminders

**Why:** Data stales quickly.

Document next review dates in `docs/data-sources.md` under `refresh_cadence`.

---

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Ignoring Fallback Copy

**Problem:** Optional sections collapse awkwardly if data removed.

**Fix:** Test with testimonials or metrics temporarily removed.

### 2. Skipping Device Testing

**Problem:** Tables overflow or timeline becomes unreadable.

**Fix:** Test on small screens and ensure horizontal scroll has focus styles.

## üîç Portfolio Pulse Audit Scenario

1. Execute accessibility, performance, and data checks outlined above.
2. Annotate screenshots of Lighthouse results for future reference.
3. Record outstanding actions or missing approvals in the retro log.
4. Open tickets for work that must carry into Module 5.

#### Expected Result

You have confidence that the credibility section is accurate, accessible, and
documented, clearing the path for Module 5's production polish.

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

### Data Integrity

-  [ ] Metrics match source docs and include refresh dates.
-  [ ] Testimonials have valid consent records.

### Accessibility & Performance

-  [ ] Table headers, timeline, and testimonials pass automated checks.
-  [ ] LCP impact measured and within acceptable range.

### Documentation & Retro

-  [ ] Layout, state, and data docs updated.
-  [ ] Retro notes capture wins, risks, and follow-ups.

## Next Steps

-  Review retro findings to prioritize Module 5 tasks focused on advanced HTML5
   features and production polish.
