# Semantic Tables

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Present comparative metrics in accessible tables.
-  [ ] Provide captions and summaries to set context.
-  [ ] Prepare tables for responsive layouts while keeping semantics intact.

## Why It Matters

Tables communicate structured comparisons better than ad-hoc divs. Proper
semantics ensure screen readers and data extraction tools interpret your results
correctly.

## Core Table Pattern

```html
<table class="metrics-table">
   <caption>
      Portfolio Pulse impact snapshot
   </caption>
   <thead>
      <tr>
         <th scope="col">Outcome</th>
         <th scope="col">Baseline</th>
         <th scope="col">After engagement</th>
         <th scope="col">Change</th>
      </tr>
   </thead>
   <tbody>
      <tr>
         <th scope="row">Onboarding completion</th>
         <td>58%</td>
         <td>90%</td>
         <td><span class="metric-up">+32 pts</span></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <th scope="row">Support tickets</th>
         <td>84/mo</td>
         <td>31/mo</td>
         <td><span class="metric-down">‚àí63%</span></td>
      </tr>
   </tbody>
</table>
```

Add a visually hidden `<p class="sr-only">` summary when context requires more
than the caption can contain.

## Responsive Strategies

-  Maintain table semantics; avoid switching to cards on mobile.
-  Allow horizontal scrolling with `overflow-x: auto` and visible focus states.
-  Consider stacked headings using `aria-describedby` when space is tight.

Document responsive decisions in `docs/layout.shared.md` under "Metrics table".

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Scope Attributes

**Why:** Helps assistive tech relate headers to data.

Use `scope="row"` on the first cell of each row when single level.

### 2. Highlight Trends Semantically

**Why:** Color alone is insufficient.

Use `aria-label` or inline text ("increase", "decrease") to reinforce meaning.

---

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Merging Cells Without Headers

**Problem:** Complex tables become indecipherable.

**Fix:** Use `headers` attribute referencing `id` of header cells when spanning.

### 2. Removing Captions for Style

**Problem:** Screen reader users lose context.

**Fix:** Keep `<caption>` and style with CSS to meet brand guidelines.

## üîç Portfolio Pulse Action Items

1. Build the impact table markup in a scratch file or component demo.
2. Add caption, summary, and trend text that match Module 4 data sources.
3. Update `docs/data-sources.md` noting which metrics feed the table and refresh
   cadence.
4. Log responsive behavior in `docs/layout.shared.md` for future CSS work.

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

-  [ ] Table includes caption, scope attributes, and accessible summary.
-  [ ] Responsive approach documented and tested with keyboard scroll.
-  [ ] Trend indicators use text in addition to color.
-  [ ] Data source references linked in documentation.
