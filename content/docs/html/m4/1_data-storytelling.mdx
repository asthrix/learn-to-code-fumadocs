# Data Storytelling

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Inventory metrics, testimonials, and milestones that reinforce Avery's
       expertise.
-  [ ] Confirm permissions and update governance docs.
-  [ ] Plan how each data point aligns to the portfolio narrative.

## Why It Matters

Numbers without context feel hollow. Strategy ensures every metric and quote
serves a clear story while respecting confidentiality and consent.

## Data Inventory Workshop

1. **Quantitative Results** ‚Äî retention uplift, conversion changes, task time
   improvements.
2. **Milestones** ‚Äî product launches, speaking engagements, awards.
3. **Testimonials** ‚Äî client quotes, peer endorsements, community praise.

Record each item in `docs/data-sources.md` with fields:

```
- type: metric | milestone | testimonial
  description: "Reduced onboarding drop-off by 32%"
  source: "Fintech client Q2 report"
  permission: "Approved 2025-03-12"
  refresh_cadence: "Quarterly"
```

## Narrative Alignment

Map data points to site sections in `notes/module-4-plan.md`:

| Story Beat | Data Evidence                     | Placement         |
| ---------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Discovery  | Usability test participation rate | Timeline          |
| Design     | Conversion lift metric            | Highlight card    |
| Impact     | Client quote about collaboration  | Testimonial block |

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Validate Sources

**Why:** Misattributed metrics erode credibility.

Confirm each data point with the stakeholder who originally shared it.

### 2. Capture Context Copy

**Why:** Short supporting text clarifies what success looks like.

Draft one sentence explaining how the metric was achieved.

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Overloading with Metrics

**Problem:** Too many numbers overwhelm readers.

**Fix:** Prioritize 3‚Äì5 high-impact data points and link to deeper dives.

### 2. Forgetting Confidentiality Constraints

**Problem:** Sharing sensitive metrics without NDA clearance.

**Fix:** Document permissions and anonymize clients when required.

## üîç Portfolio Pulse Action Items

1. Populate `docs/data-sources.md` with approved metrics, milestones, and
   testimonials.
2. Draft supporting copy snippets in `notes/module-4-plan.md`.
3. Flag any data that still requires approval; add TODOs with owners.
4. Share the plan with Avery for a quick sign-off before building.

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

-  [ ] Data inventory complete with permissions and refresh cadence.
-  [ ] Narrative map highlights where each data point will appear.
-  [ ] Stakeholder sign-off captured in notes or retro log.
-  [ ] Confidential items anonymized or deferred.
