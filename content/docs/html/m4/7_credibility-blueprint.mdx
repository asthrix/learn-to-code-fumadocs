# Credibility Blueprint

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Document the structure of the credibility section.
-  [ ] Align metrics, timeline, testimonials, and highlights into a cohesive
       flow.
-  [ ] Capture dependencies and analytics hooks for implementation.

## Why It Matters

A blueprint keeps implementation focused. It prevents scope creep and ensures
all stakeholders agree on the order, copy, and interactions before you touch the
codebase.

## HTML Outline

```
<section id="credibility" aria-labelledby="credibility-title">
   <header>...</header>
   <div class="credibility-grid">
      <section class="credibility-highlights">...</section>
      <aside class="credibility-metrics">...</aside>
      <section class="credibility-timeline">...</section>
      <section class="credibility-testimonials">...</section>
   </div>
   <footer>...</footer>
</section>
```

### Ordering Guidelines

1. Anchor with highlights that summarize outcomes.
2. Follow with metrics table for quantitative detail.
3. Present timeline milestones to illustrate sustained impact.
4. Close with testimonials and CTA to start a conversation.

Document the outline in `docs/layout.shared.md` under "Credibility section".

## Dependency Matrix

Create a table in `notes/module-4-plan.md`:

| Component     | Data Source                          | Refresh    | Owner     |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------- | --------- |
| Highlights    | `data-sources.md` IDs: highlight\_\* | Quarterly  | Avery     |
| Metrics table | analytics dashboard export           | Monthly    | You       |
| Timeline      | retro notes, engagement logs         | Semiannual | You       |
| Testimonials  | consent log                          | Annual     | Marketing |

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Keep Sections Optional

**Why:** Blueprint should handle missing data gracefully.

Plan copy for when a testimonial or metric is unavailable.

### 2. Align CTAs With Business Goals

**Why:** Credibility should funnel visitors to next steps.

Decide whether the CTA points to case studies, contact form, or newsletter.

---

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Ignoring Content Governance

**Problem:** Metrics become stale.

**Fix:** Assign refresh cadence in the dependency matrix and log reminders.

### 2. Overcomplicating Layout in Markup

**Problem:** Nesting layout divs into HTML blueprint.

**Fix:** Keep structure semantic; document layout ideas for CSS separately.

## üîç Portfolio Pulse Action Items

1. Capture the full outline in `docs/layout.shared.md` with headings, roles, and
   fallback copy.
2. Update `docs/state-architecture.md` with analytics IDs and event triggers per
   component.
3. Share the blueprint with Avery and note feedback in `notes/module-4-plan.md`.
4. Prepare TODOs for any missing data or consent in `docs/validation-log.md`.

---

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

-  [ ] Blueprint documented with structure, fallbacks, and CTAs.
-  [ ] Dependency matrix lists data sources, refresh cadence, and owners.
-  [ ] Stakeholder approval or feedback captured in notes.
-  [ ] Outstanding risks logged ahead of implementation.
