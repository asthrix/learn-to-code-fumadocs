# Structured Highlights

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Build outcome cards that combine metrics, copy, and actions.
-  [ ] Select the right semantic element for quantitative data.
-  [ ] Document analytics and accessibility guidelines for highlight components.

## Why It Matters

Highlight cards surface marquee results quickly. Semantic foundations make them
understandable to assistive tech, search engines, and future automation.

## Highlight Card Pattern

```html
<section class="highlight" aria-labelledby="highlight-retention">
   <header>
      <h3 id="highlight-retention">Retention stabilized in 90 days</h3>
      <p>Client: FluxHealth ¬∑ Engagement: Service Design Sprint</p>
   </header>
   <p class="stat">
      <data value="0.18">18%</data> churn reduction after rollout
   </p>
   <p class="supporting">
      Introduced onboarding checkpoints and guidance flows.
   </p>
   <footer>
      <a href="/case-studies/fluxhealth.html" data-cta="highlight-retention">
         Read the playbook
      </a>
   </footer>
</section>
```

### When to Use `<meter>`

```html
<meter
   min="0"
   max="100"
   value="92"
   optimum="95"
   aria-describedby="metric-satisfaction"
>
   92%
</meter>
<p id="metric-satisfaction">Stakeholder satisfaction post engagement.</p>
```

Use `<meter>` for bounded values with target ranges (satisfaction, uptime).

---

## Accessibility Notes

-  Provide textual interpretation of the metric (`<data>` text) near the
   element.
-  Associate `<meter>` or `<progress>` with descriptive copy via
   `aria-describedby`.
-  Maintain focus order so buttons and links remain discoverable.

Document component APIs and analytics data attributes in
`docs/state-architecture.md`.

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Keep Sections Self-Contained

**Why:** Each highlight should stand alone when shared or rearranged.

### 2. Balance Quantitative and Qualitative Copy

**Why:** Metrics need short narratives to feel credible.

Provide 1‚Äì2 sentences describing how the result was achieved.

---

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Using `<div>`-Only Cards

**Problem:** Loses semantic meaning.

**Fix:** Wrap each card in `<section>` or `<article>` with headings.

### 2. Forgetting Machine-Readable Values

**Problem:** Informational cards become dead ends for automation.

**Fix:** Use `<data>` or `data-*` attributes to store raw values.

---

## üîç Portfolio Pulse Action Items

1. Draft three highlight cards representing top outcomes.
2. Choose whether each card needs `<data>` or `<meter>` based on metric type.
3. Update `docs/state-architecture.md` with data attributes and event tracking.
4. Log content dependencies in `docs/data-sources.md`.

---

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

-  [ ] Each highlight includes heading, metric, supporting copy, and CTA.
-  [ ] Metrics use appropriate semantic elements (data/meter/progress).
-  [ ] Documentation updated with tracking and data references.
-  [ ] Keyboard navigation confirmed for focusable elements.
