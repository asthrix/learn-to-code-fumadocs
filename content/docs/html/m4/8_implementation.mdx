# Module 4 Implementation

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Assemble the credibility section in Portfolio Pulse.
-  [ ] Apply semantic patterns for tables, highlights, timeline, and
       testimonials.
-  [ ] Document data connections and analytics hooks for collaborators.

## Project Context

This section proves Avery's impact. It bridges storytelling (Module 3) and
conversion (Module 5), so accuracy and accessibility are critical.

## Assembly Steps

### 1. Section Wrapper

```html
<section id="credibility" aria-labelledby="credibility-title">
   <header>
      <h2 id="credibility-title">
         Proof you're investing in measurable change
      </h2>
      <p>Metrics, milestones, and endorsements from recent collaborations.</p>
   </header>
   <div class="credibility-grid">
      <!-- highlights, metrics, timeline, testimonials -->
   </div>
   <footer>
      <a href="#contact" class="cta" data-cta="credibility-contact">
         Partner with Avery
      </a>
   </footer>
</section>
```

### 2. Highlights Column

Insert highlight cards from Lesson 6 with `<data>` and CTA links.

### 3. Metrics Table

Reuse the semantic table from Lesson 2, ensuring caption and trend indicators
are present.

### 4. Timeline

Add the `<ol>` timeline from Lesson 4 with `<time>` markers and CTA links.

### 5. Testimonials

Include 1‚Äì2 testimonial figures with `<blockquote>` and consent metadata.

Document final structure in `docs/layout.shared.md` and capture component IDs in
`docs/state-architecture.md`.

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Keep Copy Flexible

**Why:** Some data points may be optional.

Wrap optional sections in `<section>` with fallback copy like "More case studies
coming soon".

### 2. Align CTA Targets

**Why:** Reinforces lead generation.

Link to the contact form or a flagship case study based on business goals.

---

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Mixing Presentational Divs Into Data Structures

**Problem:** Semantics degrade.

**Fix:** Use existing patterns; leave layout adjustments to CSS.

### 2. Forgetting Analytics Attributes

**Problem:** Marketing loses insight into engagement.

**Fix:** Add `data-cta` values documented in state architecture notes.

## üî® Implement in Portfolio Pulse

1. Update the credibility section in `index.html` (or equivalent template) with
   the assembled markup.
2. Ensure table, timeline, and testimonials reference real data from
   `docs/data-sources.md`.
3. Add `data-cta` attributes and update `docs/state-architecture.md` with
   tracking events.
4. Commit with `git commit -am "feat: add credibility section"` after testing.

#### Expected Result

Visitors can scan Avery's outcomes, milestones, and endorsements quickly, and
stakeholders have documentation to keep data current.
