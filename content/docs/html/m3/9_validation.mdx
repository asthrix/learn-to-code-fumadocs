# Module 3 Validation

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Validate the gallery across devices and connection speeds.
-  [ ] Confirm accessibility, captions, and transcripts meet guidelines.
-  [ ] Update documentation and retro notes ahead of Module 4.

## Why It Matters

Media-heavy sections are fragile. A thorough validation round ensures responsive
imagery, embeds, and documentation stay aligned.

---

## Validation Workflow

### 1. Cross-Browser & Device Testing

-  Desktop: Chrome, Firefox, Safari.
-  Mobile: iOS Safari, Android Chrome.
-  Reduce network to `Fast 3G` to confirm lazy loading behaves as expected.

### 2. Accessibility Audits

-  Run Lighthouse Accessibility; target score ‚â• 95.
-  Use axe DevTools to check heading hierarchy, figure usage, and consent
   interactions.
-  Test screen reader flow (VoiceOver or NVDA) through the gallery and embedded
   media.

### 3. Performance Checks

-  Measure Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) and cumulative layout shift (CLS)
   after implementing responsive images.
-  Capture before/after metrics in `docs/validation-log.md` with date and commit
   hash.

### 4. Documentation

-  Ensure `docs/media-inventory.md` reflects final assets, alt text, and
   transcripts.
-  Update `docs/performance-budgets.md` with actual asset sizes.
-  Record insights and action items in `notes/module-3-retro.md` (create if
   missing).

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Validate Consent Flows

**Why:** Embedded media can fail or load slowly without user consent.

Test both consent-granted and consent-denied paths to confirm fallbacks render
helpful copy.

### 2. Monitor Analytics with Preview IDs

**Why:** Ensures `data-cta` attributes map correctly before production tracking.

Use your analytics sandbox to confirm events fire without personal data.

---

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Skipping Transcript Review

**Problem:** Typos or missing sections reduce accessibility.

**Fix:** Proof transcripts and caption files against source material.

### 2. Leaving TODOs in HTML

**Problem:** Placeholder comments leak into production.

**Fix:** Resolve or track TODOs in the retro log with owners and due dates.

## üîç Portfolio Pulse Audit Scenario

1. Run full audits and capture screenshots of Lighthouse results.
2. Validate keyboard navigation through gallery items, ensuring focus styles are
   visible.
3. Simulate slow networks to watch lazy loading and consent gating behavior.
4. Update retro notes with findings, risks, and Module 4 readiness.

#### Expected Result

You can confidently demonstrate that Portfolio Pulse delivers fast, accessible
media storytelling.

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

### Accessibility

-  [ ] Headings, figures, and captions pass automated and manual checks.
-  [ ] Captions/transcripts verified for accuracy.

### Performance

-  [ ] LCP ‚â§ 2.5s on Fast 3G.
-  [ ] CLS ‚â§ 0.1 after responsive image updates.

### Documentation

-  [ ] Media inventory, performance budgets, and state architecture docs
       updated.
-  [ ] Module 3 retro notes recorded with next steps.

---

## Next Steps

-  Review retro findings to prioritize content updates for Module 4.
-  Identify any data presentation needs that link current gallery outcomes to
   upcoming case study details.
