# Video & Audio Embeds

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Integrate native `<video>`/`<audio>` players with accessibility in mind.
-  [ ] Wrap third-party embeds with consent and performance controls.
-  [ ] Provide meaningful fallbacks when media is blocked or fails.

## Why It Matters

Without controls, embedded media can harm privacy, slow pages, or exclude users.
Responsible integration delivers rich storytelling without sacrificing trust.

## Native Media Players

### Video Example

```html
<video
   class="testimonial-video"
   controls
   preload="metadata"
   poster="/images/showcase/testimonial-poster.jpg"
   width="1280"
   height="720"
>
   <source src="/media/testimonial-client.avc.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
   <track
      kind="captions"
      src="/transcripts/testimonial-client.vtt"
      srclang="en"
      label="English"
      default
   />
   <p>
      Watch Avery's client testimonial (captions available). If the video does
      not load, read the
      <a href="/transcripts/testimonial-client.html">transcript</a>.
   </p>
</video>
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Include a `<p>` fallback inside `<video>` to keep the transcript accessible
> if playback fails.

### Audio Example

```html
<audio controls preload="metadata">
   <source src="/media/podcast-clip.ogg" type="audio/ogg" />
   <source src="/media/podcast-clip.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
   Your browser does not support the audio element. Read the
   <a href="/transcripts/podcast-clip.html">summary</a> instead.
</audio>
```

## Third-Party Embeds

Wrap YouTube or Vimeo iframes in a consent component to prevent auto-loading
trackers.

```html
<div class="embed-gate" data-consent>
   <p>This talk is hosted on YouTube. Play to allow YouTube to load.</p>
   <button type="button" data-consent-trigger>
      Play "Designing Trustworthy Forms"
   </button>
</div>
```

Enhance with JavaScript to swap the container with the iframe only after user
consent. Document script behavior in `docs/state-architecture.md`.

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Respect User Preferences

**Why:** Autoplaying media surprises users and violates accessibility
guidelines.

-  Disable autoplay by default.
-  Provide clear play/stop controls.

### 2. Sandbox Third-Party Iframes

**Why:** Limits security risks and access to user data.

```html
<iframe
   src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xyz"
   title="Client testimonial"
   loading="lazy"
   allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture"
   sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-presentation"
></iframe>
```

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Missing Poster Images

**Problem:** Users see a blank rectangle before playback.

**Fix:** Provide descriptive poster images that preview the content.

### 2. Ignoring Keyboard Controls

**Problem:** Embedded players inaccessible to non-pointer users.

**Fix:** Test tab order and keyboard activation; for custom controls, manage
focus states.

## üîç Portfolio Pulse Action Items

1. Add a native `<video>` testimonial with captions and transcript.
2. Gate any third-party iframe behind a consent interaction.
3. Document embed behavior and dependencies in `docs/state-architecture.md`.
4. Update `docs/validation-log.md` with privacy considerations and testing
   notes.

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

-  [ ] All media provides captions, transcripts, or text alternatives.
-  [ ] Consent gates prevent third-party loading before approval.
-  [ ] Keyboard and screen reader navigation verified.
-  [ ] Fallback content exists for users who block media.
