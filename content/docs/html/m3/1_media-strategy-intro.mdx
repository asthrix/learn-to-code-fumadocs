# Media Strategy Introduction

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Inventory the visuals that support Avery's story.
-  [ ] Define media guardrails for performance, licensing, and consent.
-  [ ] Outline documentation updates for future collaborators.

## Why It Matters

Images and embeds often carry most of a portfolio's emotional weight‚Äîbut they
are also hotspots for performance regressions and accessibility gaps. A
strategy-first approach ensures every asset earns its place and respects users'
constraints.

## Portfolio Pulse Media Audit

### 1. Collect Source Material

-  Case study cover images
-  Workshop photographs
-  Logo treatments or UI mockups
-  Video testimonials or talks

Log attribution, usage rights, and original dimensions in
`docs/media-inventory.md`.

### 2. Assign Story Beats

Match each asset to the narrative arc:

-  Discovery ‚Üí showcase research deliverables
-  Design ‚Üí highlight UI explorations
-  Impact ‚Üí present before/after snapshots or metrics graphics

Document the pairing in `notes/module-3-plan.md` with context on why each asset
matters.

### 3. Define Success Criteria

| Goal                            | Metric                      | Owner |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ----- |
| Keep hero gallery under 1.2MB   | Lighthouse Performance ‚â• 90 | Avery |
| Provide accessible descriptions | Alt text log updated        | You   |
| Respect third-party privacy     | Embeds gated until consent  | Team  |

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Start with Copy

**Why:** Narrative clarity leads to better visual decisions.

Draft a short paragraph describing the story each asset should communicate
before cropping or compressing.

### 2. Treat Media Like Structured Data

**Why:** Consistent metadata enables automation later.

```

  focus: discovery
  alt: "Avery leading a sticky-note workshop during discovery sprint"
  license: "CC BY-NC"
```

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Choosing Assets Before Setting Budgets

**Problem:** High-res exports balloon page weight.

**Fix:** Define max file sizes per asset type before exporting.

### 2. Ignoring Legal & Privacy Constraints

**Problem:** Embedding third-party content without consent banners.

**Fix:** Flag any embed that sets cookies and plan for privacy-gate UI.

## üîç Portfolio Pulse Action Items

1. Create `docs/media-inventory.md` if it does not exist and log current assets.
2. Update `docs/accessibility-manifesto.md` with media-specific guidelines (alt
   text quality, caption timelines).
3. Add a TODO in `notes/module-3-plan.md` to revisit analytics once media is
   implemented.
4. Share the strategy outline with stakeholders for async review.

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

-  [ ] Media inventory created with source, license, and intended story beat.
-  [ ] Performance and accessibility goals documented.
-  [ ] Stakeholders acknowledge media plan or provide feedback.
-  [ ] Retro log updated with strategy risks for Module 3.
