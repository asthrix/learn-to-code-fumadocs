# Module 3 · Media & Embedded Storytelling

Module 3 transforms Portfolio Pulse into a compelling visual narrative. You will
ship a responsive gallery, integrate embedded media responsibly, and maintain
performance budgets that keep the experience fast on any device.

### What You Will Deliver

-  Responsive images with `srcset`, `sizes`, and correct intrinsic dimensions.
-  Accessible media with captions, transcripts, and descriptive alt text.
-  Embedded video or audio assets that respect privacy and performance.
-  A gallery section that tells the portfolio story without sacrificing speed.

### Lesson Map

1. **Media Strategy Introduction** — align storytelling goals with performance
   guardrails.
2. **Responsive Images** — master `srcset`, `sizes`, and intrinsic sizing.
3. **Art Direction with `<picture>`** — tailor imagery across breakpoints and
   formats.
4. **Media Performance** — set budgets, lazy load, and choose optimal formats.
5. **Accessible Media** — craft alt text, captions, and transcripts that add
   meaning.
6. **Video & Audio Embeds** — integrate rich media with fallbacks and consent.
7. **Gallery Blueprint** — structure figures, captions, and callouts for the
   showcase.
8. **Implementation** — build the full showcase gallery for Portfolio Pulse.
9. **Validation** — audit accessibility, performance, and documentation.

Bring your project brief, accessibility manifesto, and validation logs. You will
expand each to cover media governance and analytics notes.
