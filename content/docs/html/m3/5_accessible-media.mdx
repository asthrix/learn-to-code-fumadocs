# Accessible Media

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Draft alt text and captions that communicate intent.
-  [ ] Provide transcripts and captions for audio/video content.
-  [ ] Update accessibility documentation with media-specific guidelines.

## Why It Matters

Media should amplify, not gatekeep, your story. Accessible descriptions broaden
your audience and improve SEO while respecting legal requirements.

## Alt Text Framework

Use the "What, Context, Purpose" checklist:

1. **What:** Describe the primary subject.
2. **Context:** Highlight relevant surroundings.
3. **Purpose:** Explain why the image matters in this case study.

Example:
`"Avery presenting usability test findings to a fintech client, highlighting a simplified onboarding flow."`

Document each alt text decision in `docs/media-inventory.md` under `alt_text`.

## Figures and Captions

Wrap showcase imagery in `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` to bind media with
narrative.

```html
<figure class="case-study-figure">
   <img
      src="/images/showcase/usability-session-768.jpg"
      srcset="..."
      alt="Avery facilitating a remote usability session with task checklist on screen"
      width="1280"
      height="853"
      loading="lazy"
   />
   <figcaption>
      Remote testing uncovered friction in the onboarding checklist, improving
      completion rates by 32%.
   </figcaption>
</figure>
```

---

## Captions & Transcripts

-  Use `<track kind="captions" srclang="en">` for native `<video>` elements.
-  Provide transcript download links for long-form audio.
-  For third-party embeds (YouTube, Vimeo), confirm captions exist or upload
   them.

Store transcript files in `public/transcripts/` and reference them within the
UI.

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Collaborate on Alt Text

**Why:** The creator of the asset often knows nuances best.

Pair with Avery or stakeholders to validate descriptions before publishing.

### 2. Use Plain Language

**Why:** Jargon-heavy captions reduce comprehension.

Focus on the outcome or insight rather than tool names unless critical.

---

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Repeating Nearby Body Copy

**Problem:** Redundant alt text adds noise.

**Fix:** Provide unique detail that complements the surrounding copy.

### 2. Auto-Captions Without Review

**Problem:** Automated captions misrepresent names or metrics.

**Fix:** Download and edit caption files before uploading.

## üîç Portfolio Pulse Action Items

1. Draft alt text for all gallery assets using the framework above.
2. Wrap at least two showcase images in `<figure>` + `<figcaption>`.
3. Produce transcripts or summary notes for any audio/video assets.
4. Update `docs/accessibility-manifesto.md` with media-specific success
   criteria.

---

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

-  [ ] All images have purposeful alt text documented in the inventory.
-  [ ] Captions/transcripts exist for every media asset.
-  [ ] Figures use `<figcaption>` to connect narrative and visuals.
-  [ ] Accessibility documentation reflects media guidelines.
