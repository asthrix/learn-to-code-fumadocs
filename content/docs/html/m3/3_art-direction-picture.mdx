# Art Direction with `<picture>`

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Serve modern formats with graceful fallbacks.
-  [ ] Swap crops or compositions per breakpoint to reinforce storytelling.
-  [ ] Maintain accessible markup when using `<picture>`.

## Why It Matters

Case studies look different on a phone than on a desktop. `<picture>` lets you
tailor imagery to each context without sacrificing performance or accessibility.

---

## When to Reach for `<picture>`

-  Art direction: mobile needs tighter crop vs. desktop panorama.
-  Format switching: deliver AVIF or WebP while falling back to JPEG.
-  Density-specific logos or icons.

### Example

```html
<picture>
   <source
      type="image/avif"
      srcset="
         /images/showcase/sketching-640.avif   640w,
         /images/showcase/sketching-1280.avif 1280w
      "
      sizes="(min-width: 960px) 45vw, 90vw"
   />
   <source
      type="image/webp"
      srcset="
         /images/showcase/sketching-640.webp   640w,
         /images/showcase/sketching-1280.webp 1280w
      "
      sizes="(min-width: 960px) 45vw, 90vw"
   />
   <img
      src="/images/showcase/sketching-1280.jpg"
      srcset="
         /images/showcase/sketching-640.jpg   640w,
         /images/showcase/sketching-1280.jpg 1280w
      "
      sizes="(min-width: 960px) 45vw, 90vw"
      width="1280"
      height="853"
      alt="Sketching interface ideas alongside sticky notes during a design sprint"
   />
</picture>
```

> üí° The `<img>` element provides the fallback alt text and dimensions.
> `<source>` elements should not include `alt` attributes.

## Art-Directed Crops

Plan composition per breakpoint:

| Breakpoint | Goal                               | Crop                |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Mobile     | Highlight user interaction         | Tight crop on hands |
| Tablet     | Balance context and detail         | Medium crop         |
| Desktop    | Showcase collaborative environment | Wide crop           |

Export dedicated assets and document in `docs/media-inventory.md` under
`art_direction` notes.

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Prioritize Format Sources

**Why:** Browsers choose the first compatible `<source>`.

Order from most efficient (AVIF) to least (JPEG) so modern browsers pick the
best option.

### 2. Keep `sizes` Consistent

**Why:** Mismatched `sizes` across `<source>` elements causes inconsistent
choices.

Ensure every `<source>` and the `<img>` share identical `sizes` values.

---

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Forgetting Fallback Formats

**Problem:** Older browsers fail to display the image.

**Fix:** Always include an `<img>` fallback even if you use AVIF/WebP.

### 2. Overusing `<picture>`

**Problem:** Adds complexity when a single responsive `<img>` would suffice.

**Fix:** Reserve `<picture>` for meaningful art direction or format switching.

## üîç Portfolio Pulse Action Items

1. Identify one hero image that benefits from art-directed crops.
2. Export AVIF, WebP, and JPEG versions for each crop.
3. Update the case study hero markup to use `<picture>`.
4. Record browser support notes and fallbacks in `docs/validation-log.md`.

---

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

-  [ ] `<picture>` markup renders correctly across target browsers.
-  [ ] Alt text, dimensions, and `sizes` remain accurate.
-  [ ] Performance budgets still pass after adding new sources.
-  [ ] Documentation updated with art direction rationale and asset variants.
