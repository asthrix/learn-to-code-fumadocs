# Gallery Blueprint

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Map the gallery structure using semantic HTML.
-  [ ] Decide how many showcase items and which metadata each requires.
-  [ ] Align copy, media, and CTAs to guide prospective clients.

## Why It Matters

A blueprint prevents ad-hoc gallery markup that confuses users and search
engines. Structure the story before writing code to keep implementation
deliberate.

## Gallery Architecture

```
<section id="showcase" aria-labelledby="showcase-title">
   <div class="section-intro">...</div>
   <ol class="case-study-gallery">
      <li>
         <article>
            <header>...</header>
            <figure>...</figure>
            <footer>...</footer>
         </article>
      </li>
      ...
   </ol>
</section>
```

### Key Elements

-  `<section>` with heading and introduction copy.
-  Ordered list `<ol>` to express deliberate sequence.
-  `<article>` per case study to support independent sharing.
-  `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` for primary visuals.
-  `<footer>` with CTA link to detailed case study.

Document this structure in `docs/layout.shared.md` under a new "Showcase
gallery" section.

---

## Metadata Requirements

Create a YAML block per case study in `docs/media-inventory.md`:

```
- slug: fintech-onboarding
  title: "Fintech Onboarding Redesign"
  outcome: "Increased completion rate by 32%"
  asset: "/images/showcase/fintech-onboarding-1280.jpg"
  alt: "Avery presenting improved onboarding screens"
  cta: "/case-studies/fintech-onboarding.html"
```

Include analytics tags (`data-cta="fintech-gallery"`) to connect with Module 5
instrumentation.

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Maintain Hierarchy Consistency

**Why:** Reusable structures make CMS integration easier later.

### 2. Plan for Empty States

**Why:** The gallery should still render gracefully with fewer case studies.

Add copy for when only one story is available.

---

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Nesting Headings Out of Order

**Problem:** Jumping from `h2` to `h4` harms accessibility.

**Fix:** Ensure each article uses an `h3` heading, with nested `h4` only when
needed.

### 2. Mixing Structural and Presentational Classes

**Problem:** Layout classes leak into content templates.

**Fix:** Keep markup semantic; leave grid/flex styling for CSS.

## üîç Portfolio Pulse Action Items

1. Sketch the gallery structure and copy in `notes/module-3-plan.md`.
2. Update `docs/layout.shared.md` with HTML outline and rationale.
3. Define analytics data attributes in your blueprint (e.g., `data-cta`).
4. Secure sign-off on the gallery narrative before coding.

---

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

-  [ ] Blueprint documented with semantic hierarchy and element choices.
-  [ ] Metadata defined for each gallery item.
-  [ ] Empty states considered and documented.
-  [ ] Stakeholder approval recorded in retro or notes.
