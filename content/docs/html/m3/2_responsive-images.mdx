# Responsive Images

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Use `srcset` and `sizes` to tailor images per viewport.
-  [ ] Preserve intrinsic dimensions to avoid layout shift.
-  [ ] Plan asset exports that meet Module 3 performance goals.

## Why It Matters

Serving a single large image punishes mobile users; serving a tiny one wastes
high-density displays. Responsive images balance fidelity and speed, keeping
Portfolio Pulse fast for every client.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Intrinsic Dimensions

Always set `width` and `height` attributes to reserve space and prevent
cumulative layout shift (CLS).

```html
<img
   src="/images/showcase/workshop-768.jpg"
   srcset="
      /images/showcase/workshop-480.jpg   480w,
      /images/showcase/workshop-768.jpg   768w,
      /images/showcase/workshop-1280.jpg 1280w
   "
   sizes="(min-width: 960px) 50vw, 90vw"
   width="1280"
   height="853"
   alt="Avery guiding stakeholders through a service blueprint workshop"
   loading="lazy"
   decoding="async"
/>
```

### 2. Density vs. Layout Viewports

-  Use width descriptors (`480w`) for art that adapts to layout width.
-  Use pixel density descriptors (`1x`, `2x`) for fixed-size UI elements (logos,
   badges).

### 3. Export Workflow

| Variant | Target Width | File Size Budget |
| ------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| Mobile  | 480px        | ‚â§ 70 KB          |
| Tablet  | 768px        | ‚â§ 120 KB         |
| Desktop | 1280px       | ‚â§ 220 KB         |

Document exports in `docs/media-inventory.md` to maintain traceability.

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Match `sizes` to Layout Breakpoints

**Why:** Ensures browsers choose the optimal resource.

```
(main content width / viewport width) = sizes value
```

### 2. Preload Critical Hero Imagery

**Why:** Maintains perceived performance on largest contentful paint (LCP).

```html
<link
   rel="preload"
   as="image"
   href="/images/showcase/hero-1280.jpg"
   imagesrcset="/images/showcase/hero-768.jpg 768w, /images/showcase/hero-1280.jpg 1280w"
   imagesizes="(min-width: 960px) 50vw, 100vw"
/>
```

Add preload links sparingly and only for imagery above the fold.

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Leaving Out `width`/`height`

**Problem:** Layout shift occurs when images finish loading.

**Fix:** Always set intrinsic dimensions, even when CSS scales the image.

### 2. Overusing `loading="lazy"`

**Problem:** Lazy loading hero imagery delays paint.

**Fix:** Use `loading="eager"` or omit the attribute for above-the-fold assets.

## üîç Portfolio Pulse Action Items

1. Export responsive variants for the three strongest case studies.
2. Update markup in `portfolio/index.html` (or equivalent) to use `srcset` and
   `sizes`.
3. Record export settings and compression choices in `docs/media-inventory.md`.
4. Add a performance budget entry in `docs/validation-log.md` referencing
   Lighthouse targets.

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

-  [ ] Each showcase image has accurate intrinsic dimensions.
-  [ ] `srcset` and `sizes` values reflect actual layout breakpoints.
-  [ ] Critical hero imagery preloaded when genuinely beneficial.
-  [ ] Documentation updated with asset variants and budgets.
