## Assembly Steps

### 1. Section Scaffold

```html
<section id="showcase" aria-labelledby="showcase-title">
   <header>
      <h2 id="showcase-title">Case studies that sparked measurable change</h2>
      <p>
         Explore a curated selection of recent projects and the outcomes they
         delivered.
      </p>
   </header>
   <ol class="case-study-gallery">
      <!-- case studies -->
   </ol>
</section>
```

### 2. Case Study Article

```html
<li>
   <article class="case-study" aria-labelledby="case-study-fintech">
      <header>
         <h3 id="case-study-fintech">Fintech Onboarding Redesign</h3>
         <p class="case-study-outcome">
            Completion rate improved by 32% within 6 weeks.
         </p>
      </header>
      <figure class="case-study-figure">
         <picture>
            <source
               type="image/avif"
               srcset="
                  /images/showcase/fintech-640.avif   640w,
                  /images/showcase/fintech-1280.avif 1280w
               "
               sizes="(min-width: 960px) 45vw, 90vw"
            />
            <source
               type="image/webp"
               srcset="
                  /images/showcase/fintech-640.webp   640w,
                  /images/showcase/fintech-1280.webp 1280w
               "
               sizes="(min-width: 960px) 45vw, 90vw"
            />
            <img
               src="/images/showcase/fintech-1280.jpg"
               srcset="
                  /images/showcase/fintech-640.jpg   640w,
                  /images/showcase/fintech-1280.jpg 1280w
               "
               sizes="(min-width: 960px) 45vw, 90vw"
               width="1280"
               height="853"
               alt="Avery guiding fintech stakeholders through the streamlined onboarding flow"
               loading="lazy"
               decoding="async"
            />
         </picture>
         <figcaption>
            We simplified identity verification and set clear expectations,
            reducing drop-off at step two by 47%.
         </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <footer>
         <a
            href="/case-studies/fintech-onboarding.html"
            data-cta="fintech-gallery"
            >Read the case study</a
         >
      </footer>
   </article>
</li>
```

Replicate the `<li>` structure for each case study, customizing IDs, alt text,
captions, and analytics attributes.

### 3. Optional Embedded Media

Add a testimonial video to one case study using the consent gate pattern from
Lesson 6. Place it after the figure or within the footer as supporting evidence.

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Keep Lists Ordered When Sequence Matters

**Why:** Signals progression to assistive tech and search engines.

### 2. Group Headings With Outcomes

**Why:** Reinforces value proposition immediately under each `h3`.

---

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Forgetting `aria-labelledby`

**Problem:** Screen readers cannot tie the article to its heading.

**Fix:** Use `aria-labelledby` referencing the internal `h3`.

### 2. Mixing Grid Divs Into Markup

**Problem:** Structure becomes brittle when styling changes.

**Fix:** Keep classes purposeful; handle layout in CSS.

## üî® Implement in Portfolio Pulse

1. Update the `#showcase` section in `index.html` with the scaffold and case
   studies.
2. Ensure each figure uses responsive image markup and documented alt text.
3. Add consent-gated embed if you have rich media; otherwise, include a pull
   quote.
4. Record analytics attributes and new sections in `docs/state-architecture.md`
   and `docs/media-inventory.md`.
5. Commit with `git commit -am "feat: build portfolio showcase gallery"` once
   complete.

#### Expected Result

Prospects can explore Avery's strongest engagements through a responsive,
accessible gallery backed by documentation.
