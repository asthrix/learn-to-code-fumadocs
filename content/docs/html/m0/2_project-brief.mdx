# Portfolio Pulse Project Brief

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Document the measurable outcomes Portfolio Pulse should deliver.
-  [ ] Identify primary and secondary audiences for the site.
-  [ ] Outline the narrative arc that guides visitors through the page.
-  [ ] Capture a content inventory ready for implementation.

## Project Context

Before writing markup, lock in why the site exists and who it serves. The brief
becomes your north star for decisions about layout order, semantic emphasis, and
microcopy. Stakeholders rely on a concise brief to verify alignment before you
spend hours coding.

## Define the Strategic Pillars

### Outcomes and Signals

Translate the product vision into measurable outcomes. A good brief lists the
signals you will measure after launch (conversion rate, recruiter replies, or
time-on-page).

### Audience Personas

Portfolios rarely serve a single persona. Define the hiring manager, peer
collaborator, or client persona so you can tailor sections of the page to their
needs.

### Narrative Arc

Every section of your homepage should reinforce a story: introduce yourself,
showcase proof, share process, and invite contact. This arc keeps your markup
purposeful.

### Basic Example

```md
## Portfolio Pulse Outcomes

-  5 qualified discovery calls within 60 days of launch
-  Newsletter sign-ups growing 10% month over month
-  Recruiter follow-ups within 48 hours of contact
```

### Practical Example

```md
# Persona Profiles

1. Hiring Manager
   -  Needs to assess collaboration ability fast
   -  Prioritizes case studies with measurable impact
2. Product Founder
   -  Seeks rapid prototyping partner
   -  Wants clarity on tooling and delivery approach

# Narrative Flow

1. Hero: Promise and positioning
2. Highlights: Three case studies tied to KPIs
3. Services: What engagements look like
4. Testimonials: Social proof from past collaborators
5. Contact: Invite to book a call
```

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Tie Metrics to Visitor Actions

**Why:** Linking outcomes to actions ensures your HTML structure prioritizes
content that moves the needle.

```md
-  Outcome: More discovery calls
-  Correlated action: Form submission
-  HTML focus: Prominent call-to-action anchored in `<header>` and `<footer>`
```

### 2. Keep Personas Short and Actionable

**Why:** Personas should inform copy tone and ordering without overwhelming you
with backstory.

```md
-  Role: Head of Product
-  Primary question: "Can this person accelerate delivery?"
-  Key evidence: Metrics snapshots, process overview, collaborative testimonials
```

---

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Overloading the Brief with Hypothetical Content

**Problem:** You waste time planning sections that never ship.

```md
// Bad: 15 section ideas, no prioritization.
```

**Solution:**

```md
-  Required: Hero, Case Studies, Services, Testimonials, Contact
-  Optional: Newsletter, Speaking, Writing
```

### 2. Skipping Measurement Plans

**Problem:** Without metrics you cannot evaluate success post-launch.

```md
// Bad: "Goal is a better portfolio" with no measurable signals.
```

**Solution:**

```md
-  KPI: Discovery call bookings
-  Baseline: 0 per month
-  Target: 5 per month by quarter end
-  Tracking: Airtable + calendar integrations
```

## üî® Implement in Portfolio Pulse

### Task: Draft the Project Brief

1. Create `portfolio-pulse/docs/project-brief.md`.
2. Add sections for Outcomes, Personas, Narrative Flow, and Risks.
3. Convert your notes into concise bullet lists similar to the practical
   example.
4. Highlight open questions that need validation in later modules.
5. Commit with `git commit -am "docs: add portfolio pulse project brief"`.

#### Expected Result

You hold a project brief that guides copy decisions, informs semantic emphasis,
and sets expectations with stakeholders.
