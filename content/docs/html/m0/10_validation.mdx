# Module 0 Validation

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Complete an audit of the Module 0 deliverables.
-  [ ] Document issues, risks, and follow-ups with clear severity levels.
-  [ ] Update briefing documents so stakeholders know the current state.
-  [ ] Define priorities for Module 1 work.

## Project Context

Validation converts work-in-progress into trusted deliverables. Before moving to
Module 1, confirm the foundation is strong. A clear backlog prevents surprises
and makes collaboration smoother once designers or developers join you.

---

## Audit Workflow

### Automated Checks

Run:

-  W3C HTML validator for structural accuracy
-  axe DevTools or Lighthouse for accessibility signals
-  Link checker to ensure anchors and external links work

### Manual Review

Read the page with styles disabled, navigate using keyboard only, and test
screen reader announcements of headings and landmarks.

### Basic Example

```bash
# Using html-validate for quick feedback
npm exec html-validate index.html
```

### Practical Example

```md
## Validation Findings ¬∑ Module 0

-  ‚úÖ HTML validator: Passed (0 errors, 2 warnings about missing OG image)
-  ‚ö†Ô∏è axe DevTools: Warning about low contrast skip link (defer to Module 1
   styling)
-  ‚úÖ Keyboard navigation: Skip link, navigation, and buttons reachable
-  ‚ùå Content: Placeholder testimonials need real quotes (blocker before launch)
```

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Categorize Issues by Severity

**Why:** Severity levels (blocker, high, medium, low) help you prioritize fixes
in Module 1.

```md
-  Blocker: Missing contact form content
-  High: Placeholder testimonial copy
-  Medium: OG image placeholder
```

### 2. Share Validation Notes in Source Control

**Why:** Keeping validation logs alongside code creates visibility and documents
improvements over time.

```txt
notes/validation/module-0.md
```

---

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Treating Validation as a One-Time Task

**Problem:** Waiting until the end of the course to validate multiplies
technical debt.

```md
// Bad: no validation logs until the final module.
```

**Solution:**

```md
-  Run audits after every module.
-  Update the backlog immediately.
```

### 2. Ignoring Warnings

**Problem:** Warnings (like missing alt text) become blockers once you add
media.

```md
// Bad: "Will fix later" without creating a ticket.
```

**Solution:**

```md
-  Create backlog entries with owners and deadlines.
-  Reference them in the next module plan.
```

## üî® Implement in Portfolio Pulse

### Task: Log Validation Results

1. Create `notes/validation/module-0.md` summarizing automated and manual
   checks.
2. Record severity, owner, and due date for each follow-up item.
3. Update `docs/project-brief.md` with any scope changes discovered during
   validation.
4. Commit with `git commit -am "docs: record module 0 validation"`.

#### Expected Result

You have a transparent record of Module 0 quality checks and a backlog that
informs Module 1 priorities.

_Date:_ 2024-05-12 _Owner:_ Avery Stone

## Automated Checks

-  ‚úÖ W3C HTML validator (https://validator.w3.org/nu/) ‚Äî 0 errors, 1 warning
   for missing twitter:image asset
-  ‚ö†Ô∏è axe DevTools (Chrome) ‚Äî Low contrast on skip link (defer fix to Module 1
   styling)

## Manual Review

-  Keyboard traversal: Pass ¬∑ Skip link focuses main, navigation order matches
   layout
-  Screen reader (VoiceOver): Landmarks announced in order, testimonials article
   labeled correctly
-  Visual inspection without CSS: Content hierarchy clear, placeholders marked

## Findings & Backlog

| Severity | Item                                          | Owner | Due                |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----- | ------------------ |
| Blocker  | Replace placeholder testimonial quote         | Avery | Module 1, Lesson 3 |
| High     | Export twitter:image asset for metadata       | Avery | Module 2, Lesson 4 |
| Medium   | Style skip link focus state for contrast      | Avery | Module 1, Lesson 2 |
| Low      | Add README deploy command once hosting chosen | Avery | Module 3           |

## Decisions

-  Keep navigation labels as-is; revisit wording during copy polish.
-  No analytics scripts until privacy policy drafted (tracked in project brief).

## Next Steps

-  Update docs/project-brief.md ‚ÄúMeasurement‚Äù section with twitter:image todo.
-  Notify collaborators of pending testimonial copy request.

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

### Functionality

-  [ ] Validation log includes outcomes from at least two automated tools.
-  [ ] Manual keyboard test recorded success or remediation steps.

### Code Quality

-  [ ] Issues are categorized by severity and assigned owners.
-  [ ] Backlog entries reference relevant sections or file paths.

### Understanding

-  [ ] You can articulate why each open issue matters.
-  [ ] You know which items must be solved before Module 1 implementation.

### Project Integration

-  [ ] Project brief and notes reference validation findings.
-  [ ] Commit history reflects the validation log addition.
