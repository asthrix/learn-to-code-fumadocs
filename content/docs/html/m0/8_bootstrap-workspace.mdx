# Bootstrap the Portfolio Pulse Workspace

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Organize the `portfolio-pulse/` repository with clear folders.
-  [ ] Extract shared snippets into partials for reuse.
-  [ ] Set up documentation and assets directories with naming conventions.
-  [ ] Capture version control rituals and branching strategy.

## Project Context

Even a single-page site benefits from structure. As you layer CSS, JavaScript,
and deployment tooling, a tidy workspace prevents confusion. You will mirror
production standards by separating content, assets, and documentation.

---

## Recommended Structure

### Core Directories

-  `public/` for assets served as-is (images, icons, fonts)
-  `src/` for HTML partials, includes, and templates (if using build tooling)
-  `docs/` for briefs, notes, and process artifacts
-  `notes/` for personal reflections and validation logs

### Naming Conventions

Use kebab-case for files (`hero-section.html`, `about-story.html`) and keep
commit messages consistent (`feat:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `fix:`).

### Basic Example

```txt
portfolio-pulse/
├── docs/
│   ├── project-brief.md
│   └── accessibility.md
├── notes/
│   └── orientation.md
├── public/
│   ├── og-card.jpg
│   └── apple-touch-icon.png
└── index.html
```

### Practical Example

```txt
portfolio-pulse/
├── docs/
│   ├── project-brief.md
│   ├── accessibility.md
│   └── measurement.md
├── notes/
│   ├── orientation.md
│   └── retro-log.md
├── src/
│   ├── partials/
│   │   ├── head.html
│   │   ├── header.html
│   │   └── footer.html
│   └── includes/
│       ├── testimonials.html
│       └── services.html
├── public/
│   ├── fonts/
│   ├── images/
│   └── icons/
└── index.html
```

## ✅ Best Practices

### 1. Centralize Repeatable Snippets

**Why:** Extracting `<head>` and `<footer>` into partials keeps metadata and
contact info consistent across pages.

```html
<!-- src/partials/head.html -->
<head>
   ...
</head>
```

### 2. Adopt a Branching Strategy Early

**Why:** Even solo builders benefit from feature branches for traceability and
safe experimentation.

```bash
git checkout -b feat/hero-structure
# work...
git checkout main
git merge feat/hero-structure
```

---

## ❌ Common Mistakes

### 1. Mixing Source and Build Outputs

**Problem:** Serving files from both `src/` and root confuses deployment setups.

```txt
// Bad: compiled assets mixed with source partials in root
portfolio-pulse/
├── index.html
├── hero-section.html
├── build/
```

**Solution:**

```txt
portfolio-pulse/
├── src/
│   └── partials/
└── public/
```

### 2. Skipping README or Project Documentation

**Problem:** Collaborators (or future you) have no idea how to run or extend the
project.

```md
<!-- Bad: empty README -->
```

**Solution:**

```md
# Portfolio Pulse

-  Setup instructions
-  Deployment commands
-  Content update workflow
```

## 🔨 Implement in Portfolio Pulse

### Task: Scaffold the Workspace

1. Create the directory structure from the practical example.
2. Extract `<head>`, `<header>`, and `<footer>` markup into `src/partials/`
   while keeping `index.html` as the entry point (use server-side includes or
   copy-paste until build tooling arrives).
3. Add a `README.md` documenting repository purpose, setup, and deployment
   TODOs.
4. Commit with `git commit -am "chore: scaffold portfolio workspace"`.

#### Expected Result

You now have a disciplined folder structure that scales as the project grows and
makes onboarding straightforward.

## ✅ Validation Checklist

### Functionality

-  [ ] All required directories exist and are tracked by Git.
-  [ ] `index.html` still renders correctly after extracting partials.

### Code Quality

-  [ ] README includes setup and deployment notes.
-  [ ] Partial files use consistent casing and naming.

### Understanding

-  [ ] You can explain where future CSS/JS will live.
-  [ ] You know how to reassemble partials when using static site tooling.

### Project Integration

-  [ ] Notes log references the new structure.
-  [ ] Project brief links to documentation assets for easy collaboration.
