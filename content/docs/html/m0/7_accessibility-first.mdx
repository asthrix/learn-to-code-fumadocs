# Accessibility-First HTML Mindset

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Summarize the POUR (Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust)
       principles.
-  [ ] Ensure landmarks, headings, and focus order support keyboard users.
-  [ ] Apply ARIA attributes only when native semantics fall short.
-  [ ] Document an accessibility test plan for Portfolio Pulse.

## Project Context

Accessibility is not an add-on; it must inform every decision. Portfolio Pulse
should feel welcoming to every visitor. Aligning to accessibility best practices
from the start prevents painful refactors and signals professionalism to hiring
teams.

---

## Core Principles

### POUR Framework

-  **Perceivable:** Content must be presented in ways users can perceive (text
   alternatives, structured headings).
-  **Operable:** Interfaces must support keyboard navigation and predictable
   focus.
-  **Understandable:** Content should be clear and consistent with helpful
   feedback.
-  **Robust:** Markup should work with assistive technologies today and in the
   future.

### Landmarks & Focus

Ensure the tab order follows visual order and that skip links land on focusable
elements. Use native HTML roles before reaching for ARIA.

### Basic Example

```html
<a class="skip-link" href="#main-content">Skip to main content</a>
<header role="banner">...</header>
<main id="main-content" tabindex="-1">...</main>
<footer role="contentinfo">...</footer>
```

### Practical Example

```html
<section id="testimonials" aria-labelledby="testimonials-title">
   <h2 id="testimonials-title">Client Proof</h2>
   <article class="testimonial" aria-label="testimonial from LumenAI">
      <blockquote>
         "Avery audited our onboarding and shipped improvements in two weeks.
         Accessibility wins alone reduced support tickets by 35%."
      </blockquote>
      <footer>
         <p>
            <strong>Jordan Reyes</strong>
            <span class="role">VP Product, LumenAI</span>
         </p>
      </footer>
   </article>
</section>
```

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Use Native Elements First

**Why:** Native semantics carry built-in accessibility support. Only add ARIA
when the native element cannot express intent.

```html
<button type="button">View case study</button>
<!-- Not a div with role="button" -->
```

### 2. Keep Focus Styles Visible

**Why:** Removing outlines without providing alternatives traps keyboard users.

```html
:focus { outline: 3px solid var(--color-accent); outline-offset: 4px; }
```

---

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Using ARIA Labels Everywhere

**Problem:** Overusing ARIA increases cognitive load and can introduce
conflicts.

```html
<!-- Bad: redundant aria-label when text already descriptive -->
<a aria-label="View the contact section" href="#contact">Contact</a>
```

**Solution:**

```html
<a href="#contact">Contact</a>
```

### 2. Forgetting to Make Skip Link Targets Focusable

**Problem:** Skip links land on non-focusable elements and fail to move focus.

```html
<!-- Bad: main has no tabindex so focus does not move -->
<main id="main-content">...</main>
```

**Solution:**

```html
<main id="main-content" tabindex="-1">...</main>
```

## üî® Implement in Portfolio Pulse

### Task: Write the Accessibility Manifesto

1. Create `docs/accessibility.md` capturing accessibility goals, personas, and
   tools (axe DevTools, Lighthouse, VoiceOver/NVDA).
2. Audit `index.html` to confirm landmarks, skip links, and focus management
   follow the practical example.
3. Add TODOs for future enhancements (ARIA live regions, reduced motion
   preferences) in the manifesto.
4. Commit with `git commit -am "docs: define accessibility manifesto"`.

#### Expected Result

You now have a living document that guides accessibility decisions and ensures
Portfolio Pulse aligns with inclusive standards.

<Accordions className="mt-6">
   <Accordion title="Solution Walkthrough">
      <p>
         Reference manifesto content and landmark adjustments to align your page
         with an accessibility-first posture.
      </p>
      ```md filename="docs/accessibility.md"
      # Accessibility Manifesto

      ## Why it matters

      -  Deliver equitable access to hiring managers, recruiters, and peers.
      -  Reduce friction for visitors who rely on assistive tech or keyboard-only navigation.

      ## Personas & scenarios

      -  Jordan (screen reader user) reviewing case studies for a partner role.
      -  Maya (keyboard-only) comparing service offerings quickly.

      ## Principles

      -  Follow POUR guidelines across every module.
      -  Prefer native HTML elements; add ARIA only when semantics require.
      -  Preserve visible focus and respect reduced motion preferences.

      ## Tooling cadence

      -  axe DevTools quick pass every sprint.
      -  Lighthouse accessibility audit before launches.
      -  VoiceOver/NVDA spot checks on hero, navigation, testimonials sections.

      ## Upcoming enhancements

      -  Add aria-live summaries to form submission messages (Module 4).
      -  Provide reduced motion toggles for animations (Module 6).
      -  Document color contrast tokens in design system handoff.
      ```

      <p>
         Ensure `index.html` landmarks and focus management reflect these
         decisions:
      </p>

      ```html filename="index.html"
      <a class="skip-link" href="#main-content">Skip to main content</a>
      <header role="banner">...</header>
      <main id="main-content" tabindex="-1">...</main>
      <section id="testimonials" aria-labelledby="testimonials-title">
         <h2 id="testimonials-title">Client Proof</h2>
         <article class="testimonial" aria-label="Testimonial from LumenAI">...</article>
      </section>
      <footer role="contentinfo">...</footer>
      ```
      <p>
         Link the manifesto from `notes/orientation.md` so it stays visible to
         future collaborators as development accelerates.
      </p>

   </Accordion>
</Accordions>
