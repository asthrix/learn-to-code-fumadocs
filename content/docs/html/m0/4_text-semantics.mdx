# Text Semantics & Readability

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Use headings `<h1>` through `<h6>` to communicate structure.
-  [ ] Apply inline semantics (`<strong>`, `<em>`, `<abbr>`, `<time>`) to add
       meaning.
-  [ ] Translate narrative arcs into section headings and paragraphs.
-  [ ] Prepare content placeholders for the hero and highlights sections.

## Project Context

Portfolio Pulse persuades through words before visuals. Strong semantic markup
makes the story scannable, exposes meaning to screen readers, and gives search
engines context. Setting this foundation now means you only tweak content later
instead of rewriting markup under pressure.

## Heading Hierarchy in Practice

### Establish a Single `<h1>`

Your `<h1>` communicates the primary topic of the page. Use `<h2>` for major
sections (About, Projects) and `<h3>` or `<h4>` for nested subsections
(Individual projects, highlights).

### Inline Semantics

Use `<em>` for emphasis (changes meaning if removed) and `<strong>` for
importance. `<abbr>` clarifies acronyms, `<time>` anchors dates, and `<mark>`
can highlight new additions.

### Basic Example

```html
<main>
   <h1>Portfolio Pulse ¬∑ Avery Stone</h1>
   <p>
      <strong>Product designer</strong> focused on <em>measurable outcomes</em>.
   </p>
</main>
```

### Practical Example

```html
<section id="hero" aria-labelledby="hero-heading">
   <p class="eyebrow">Product Designer & Frontend Engineer</p>
   <h1 id="hero-heading">Designing measurable customer journeys.</h1>
   <p>
      I partner with product teams to ship experiments that increase
      <abbr title="Monthly Recurring Revenue">MRR</abbr>, boost retention, and
      create delightful support experiences.
   </p>
   <p>
      <time datetime="2024-11">Latest Case Study:</time> Rebuilt the onboarding
      flow at LumenAI, improving activation by <strong>27%</strong>.
   </p>
</section>
```

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Write Copy Outside of the Browser First

**Why:** Refining text in a notes file avoids accidental style bias and keeps
you focused on meaning.

```md
## Hero Talking Points

-  Role + differentiator
-  Proof point with metric
-  Invitation to connect
```

### 2. Keep Paragraphs Short and Intentional

**Why:** Short paragraphs improve readability and align with responsive layouts.

```html
<p>
   I lead discovery workshops, translate insights into prototypes, and work with
   engineering to ship polished experiences.
</p>
```

---

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Skipping Heading Levels

**Problem:** Jumping from `<h1>` to `<h4>` breaks document outline logic and
confuses screen reader navigation.

```html
<!-- Bad: h1 followed by h4 -->
<h1>Portfolio Pulse</h1>
<h4>Latest Projects</h4>
```

**Solution:**

```html
<h1>Portfolio Pulse</h1>
<h2>Latest Projects</h2>
<h3>LumenAI Activation</h3>
```

### 2. Using `<b>` and `<i>` for Meaningful Emphasis

**Problem:** `<b>` and `<i>` are presentational without conveying meaning to
assistive tech.

```html
<!-- Bad: purely visual emphasis -->
<p><i>Product designer</i> building experiences that grow businesses.</p>
```

**Solution:**

```html
<p><em>Product designer</em> building experiences that grow businesses.</p>
```

## üî® Implement in Portfolio Pulse

### Task: Draft Hero and Highlights Copy

1. Update `portfolio-pulse/index.html` by adding the hero section markup from
   the practical example.
2. Create a `section` with `id="highlights"` and scaffold three `<article>`
   elements with `<h3>` headings and placeholder paragraphs for case studies.
3. Use semantic inline elements (`<strong>`, `<time>`, `<abbr>`) to annotate
   metrics and timelines.
4. Record any copy placeholders in `notes/orientation.md` for future refinement.
5. Commit with `git commit -am "feat: add hero and highlights semantics"`.

#### Expected Result

Your homepage now communicates the core story using semantic HTML, ready for
more detailed content and styling.

-  [ ] Page renders the hero heading and highlights section without errors.
-  [ ] Each case study `<article>` contains a heading and supporting text.

### Code Quality

-  [ ] Heading levels increase sequentially (no skipped levels).
-  [ ] Inline semantics are used for meaning, not just styling.

### Understanding

-  [ ] You can explain when to use `<strong>` vs `<em>`.
-  [ ] You can articulate how the content map ties back to the project brief.

### Project Integration

-  [ ] Notes capture any metrics or client names that need confirmation.
-  [ ] Copy aligns with the personas defined in the project brief.
