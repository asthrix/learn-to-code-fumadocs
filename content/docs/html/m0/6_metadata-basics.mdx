# Metadata & SEO Foundations

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Configure essential metadata, including description, robots, and
       canonical tags.
-  [ ] Define Open Graph and Twitter Card data for social platforms.
-  [ ] Prepare a favicon and app icon plan for Portfolio Pulse.
-  [ ] Record analytics and privacy considerations for later integration.

## Project Context

Metadata is the handshake between your site and external systems. Search
engines, social networks, and browsers read `<head>` before the body loads.
Tight metadata improves discoverability, click-through rates, and brand
consistency. Capturing decisions now prevents last-minute scramble before
launch.

## Essential Metadata

### Required Tags

-  `charset` and `viewport` (already added)
-  `description` summarizing the page in 160 characters or fewer
-  `robots` to control indexing when staging
-  `canonical` to avoid duplicate content issues

### Social Preview

Configure Open Graph (`og:*`) and Twitter Card tags to control how links preview
in messaging and social platforms.

### Icons and Manifest

Browsers expect favicons and Apple touch icons. Later modules cover manifests,
but reserve the paths now.

### Basic Example

```html
<meta
   name="description"
   content="Avery Stone helps product teams design and ship measurable experiences."
/>
<meta name="robots" content="index, follow" />
<link rel="canonical" href="https://portfolio-pulse.example.com" />
```

### Practical Example

```html
<meta property="og:type" content="website" />
<meta property="og:title" content="Portfolio Pulse ¬∑ Avery Stone" />
<meta
   property="og:description"
   content="Product designer and frontend engineer delivering measurable product outcomes."
/>
<meta property="og:url" content="https://portfolio-pulse.example.com" />
<meta
   property="og:image"
   content="https://portfolio-pulse.example.com/og-card.jpg"
/>
<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image" />
<meta name="twitter:creator" content="@averystone" />
<link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" sizes="any" />
<link rel="icon" href="/icon.svg" type="image/svg+xml" />
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/apple-touch-icon.png" />
<link rel="manifest" href="/site.webmanifest" />
```

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Keep Descriptions Human-Readable

**Why:** Search engines display descriptions; compelling copy boosts
click-through rates.

```html
<meta
   name="description"
   content="Portfolio Pulse showcases product design work that grows revenue and improves customer journeys."
/>
```

### 2. Version-Control Assets Mentioned in Metadata

**Why:** Broken Open Graph images hurt credibility. Store preview images within
the repo or a reliable CDN.

```txt
public/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ og-card.jpg
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ favicon.ico
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ apple-touch-icon.png
```

---

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Forgetting to Update Staging Robots

**Problem:** Setting `noindex` in staging and forgetting to remove it for
production.

```html
<!-- Bad: shipped to production -->
<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow" />
```

**Solution:**

```html
<meta name="robots" content="index, follow" />
```

### 2. Using Relative URLs in Open Graph Tags

**Problem:** Social platforms require absolute URLs; relative paths break the
preview.

```html
<!-- Bad: relative URL -->
<meta property="og:image" content="/og-card.jpg" />
```

**Solution:**

```html
<meta
   property="og:image"
   content="https://portfolio-pulse.example.com/og-card.jpg"
/>
```

## üî® Implement in Portfolio Pulse

### Task: Populate Metadata

1. Update the `<head>` section in `index.html` with the practical example tags.
2. Add placeholder files (`public/og-card.jpg`, `favicon.ico`,
   `apple-touch-icon.png`) or document TODOs with expected dimensions in
   `notes/orientation.md`.
3. Record analytics/privacy plans in `docs/project-brief.md` under a new
   "Measurement" section.
4. Commit with `git commit -am "chore: configure portfolio metadata"`.

#### Expected Result

Your site now presents consistent metadata across search results and social
platforms, and you have a clear plan for assets.

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

### Functionality

-  [ ] Open Graph and Twitter tags use absolute URLs.
-  [ ] `robots` meta is set correctly for the current environment.

### Code Quality

-  [ ] Metadata order is logical and grouped (basics, social, assets).
-  [ ] Placeholder assets or TODOs are documented.

### Understanding

-  [ ] You can explain what each metadata group accomplishes.
-  [ ] You know when to toggle `noindex` (staging) vs `index` (production).

### Project Integration

-  [ ] Measurement plans exist in the project brief.
-  [ ] Notes include asset dimensions and deadlines.
