# Module 0 · Foundation Blueprint

Module 0 sets the stage for everything you build later. Across ten focused
lessons you will review HTML fundamentals, define the Portfolio Pulse narrative,
and establish a clean project workspace ready for CSS and JavaScript layering.

### What You Will Deliver

-  A `portfolio-pulse/` workspace with version control, naming conventions, and
   structure notes.
-  A base HTML document that already respects semantics, accessibility, and SEO
   hygiene.
-  A copy and asset inventory so later modules can focus on implementation
   instead of discovery.

### Lesson Map

1. **Welcome & Orientation** — align on course expectations and the Portfolio
   Pulse vision.
2. **Project Brief** — translate the portfolio goals into user stories and
   success metrics.
3. **Document Anatomy** — revisit the `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`
   partnership.
4. **Text Semantics** — structure headings, paragraphs, and inline semantics for
   readability.
5. **Navigation Patterns** — craft lists and anchor elements that scale to full
   navigation.
6. **Metadata Basics** — configure SEO, social, and language metadata the right
   way.
7. **Accessibility First** — adopt inclusive defaults before styling
   distractions arrive.
8. **Bootstrap Workspace** — scaffold the project folder with reusable partials
   and notes.
9. **Implementation** — assemble the production-ready base page for Portfolio
   Pulse.
10.   **Validation** — audit your work with professional tooling and capture
      next steps.

Keep an open notes file as you progress; the validation checklist asks you to
capture assumptions, blocked items, and follow-up tasks that feed directly into
Module 1.
