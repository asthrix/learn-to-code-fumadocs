# Module 0 Implementation

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Produce a working Portfolio Pulse homepage skeleton.
-  [ ] Verify metadata, navigation, and semantic sections render correctly.
-  [ ] Capture TODOs for content refinements in upcoming modules.
-  [ ] Record validation results from automated tooling.

## Project Context

Module 0 culminates in a cohesive HTML document that reflects the strategy and
accessibility work completed so far. This baseline powers future modules, making
enhancements additive rather than disruptive.

## Build the Page

### Assemble Sections

Ensure the hero, highlights, services placeholder, testimonials, and contact
anchor exist‚Äîeven if content is still draft. Consistent IDs ensure in-page
navigation works.

### Validate Structure

Run the W3C validator or a local HTML linter to catch mistakes before styling
begins.

### Basic Example

```html
<main id="main-content" tabindex="-1">
   <section id="hero">...</section>
   <section id="highlights">...</section>
   <section id="services">...</section>
   <section id="testimonials">...</section>
   <section id="contact">...</section>
</main>
```

### Practical Example

```html
<body>
   <a class="skip-link" href="#main-content">Skip to main content</a>
   <header role="banner">...</header>
   <main id="main-content" tabindex="-1">
      <section id="hero" aria-labelledby="hero-heading">...</section>
      <section id="highlights" aria-label="Featured case studies">...</section>
      <section id="services" aria-labelledby="services-title">...</section>
      <section id="testimonials" aria-labelledby="testimonials-title">
         ...
      </section>
      <section id="contact" aria-labelledby="contact-title">...</section>
   </main>
   <footer role="contentinfo">...</footer>
</body>
```

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Keep Sections Modular

**Why:** Treat each section as a module so you can convert them into includes or
components later.

```html
<section id="services" data-section="services">
   <h2 id="services-title">Ways we can work together</h2>
   <p>...</p>
</section>
```

### 2. Capture Outstanding Tasks Inline

**Why:** Comments or data attributes help future modules know where to inject
content or styling.

```html
<section id="testimonials">
   <!-- TODO: Replace placeholder quote after client approval -->
   <blockquote>...</blockquote>
</section>
```

---

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Mixing Presentation with Structure

**Problem:** Adding inline styles or layout tables at this stage distracts from
semantic focus.

```html
<!-- Bad: inline styles controlling layout -->
<section style="display:flex"></section>
```

**Solution:**

```html
<section id="services">...</section>
```

### 2. Forgetting to Update Navigation After Adding Sections

**Problem:** New sections without corresponding navigation links break the
experience.

```html
<!-- Bad: navigation lacks link to testimonials -->
<li><a href="#highlights">Work</a></li>
<li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
```

**Solution:**

```html
<li><a href="#testimonials">Proof</a></li>
```

## üî® Implement in Portfolio Pulse

### Task: Finalize the Baseline Page

1. Ensure the body structure matches the practical example with all five
   sections present.
2. Populate each section with draft content that aligns with your project brief.
3. Run the W3C validator (`https://validator.w3.org/nu/`) or
   `npm exec html-validate index.html` if you use a linter.
4. Document validator results and fixes in `notes/retro-log.md`.
5. Commit with `git commit -am "feat: complete module 0 baseline"`.

#### Expected Result

You have a cohesive HTML page ready for semantic deep dives and layout work in
Module 1.

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

### Functionality

-  [ ] All navigation links scroll to matching section IDs.
-  [ ] Validator reports zero errors (warnings documented).

### Code Quality

-  [ ] Each section contains a single heading and supporting copy.
-  [ ] TODO comments include context and owners if applicable.

### Understanding

-  [ ] You can explain the purpose of each section and how it maps to the brief.
-  [ ] You know which sections require new content or user research before
       launch.

### Project Integration

-  [ ] Retro log captures validator results and next actions.
-  [ ] Baseline commit is tagged or noted for future comparisons.
