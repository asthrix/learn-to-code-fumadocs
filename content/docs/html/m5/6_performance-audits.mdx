# Performance Audits

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Conduct Lighthouse, WebPageTest, and Core Web Vitals audits.
-  [ ] Analyze opportunities and plan fixes for Portfolio Pulse.
-  [ ] Record baselines and owners in documentation.

## Why It Matters

Launch readiness includes objective metrics. Regular audits protect user
experience on slow networks and keep search rankings strong.

---

## Audit Stack

1. **Lighthouse (lab)** ‚Äî run in Chrome DevTools for desktop & mobile profiles.
2. **WebPageTest** ‚Äî capture filmstrips, waterfalls, and repeat view caching.
3. **Chrome UX Report (CrUX)** ‚Äî optional field data if URL already live.
4. **Core Web Vitals** ‚Äî focus on LCP, FID (or INP), CLS.

Document scores, diagnostics, and before/after comparisons in
`docs/validation-log.md` under Module 5.

---

## Reporting Template

Add to `docs/validation-log.md`:

```
## Module 5 Performance Audit ‚Äî 2025-10-25
- Lighthouse Mobile: 96 (LCP 1.9s, CLS 0.01)
- WebPageTest (Dulles 4G): LCP 2.2s, TTFB 0.45s, Speed Index 2.5s
- Opportunities: Preload primary hero image, compress testimonial poster
- Owner: You (preload), Avery (provide updated asset)
- Follow-up: Re-run after asset optimization
```

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Test Authenticated Variants

**Why:** Some pages behave differently when logged in.

### 2. Capture Evidence

**Why:** Screenshots and HAR files help future retros.

Store evidence in `/docs/assets/perf/` or link to remote storage.

---

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Ignoring Third-Party Scripts

**Problem:** Analytics or embeds can dominate payload.

**Fix:** Note third-party impact in audit and coordinate with stakeholders.

### 2. Running Audits Once

**Problem:** Metrics fluctuate; one run can mislead.

**Fix:** Average multiple runs or rely on WebPageTest repeat tests.

## üîç Portfolio Pulse Action Items

1. Execute Lighthouse mobile/desktop audits; record scores and opportunities.
2. Run WebPageTest with target device profile and note waterfall insights.
3. Document action items in `docs/validation-log.md` with owners and due dates.
4. Update `notes/module-5-plan.md` with remediation backlog for Module 5
   implementation.

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

-  [ ] Performance audit entries completed with metrics and screenshots.
-  [ ] Owners assigned for each opportunity.
-  [ ] Follow-up dates documented.
-  [ ] Retro log updated with key learnings.
