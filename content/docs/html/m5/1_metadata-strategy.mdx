# Metadata Strategy

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Inventory current metadata and identify gaps.
-  [ ] Define canonical URLs, favicons, and feed links for Portfolio Pulse.
-  [ ] Document governance for environment-specific overrides.

## Why It Matters

Strong metadata guides crawlers, sharing bots, and browsers. Without a strategy
you risk duplicate content, broken favicons, or outdated titles during launch.

---

## Metadata Inventory

Create `docs/metadata-playbook.md` with sections for:

-  `<title>` and `<meta name="description">`
-  Canonical and alternate language URLs
-  Favicon, touch icon, and mask icon references
-  RSS/Atom feeds (if applicable) and manifest links

Log current values, owners, and update cadence.

---

## Canonical & Alternate Links

Define rules:

-  One canonical URL per page
   (`<link rel="canonical" href="https://avery.dev/">`).
-  Use trailing slashes consistently.
-  Add `rel="alternate" hreflang="en"` if localization planned.

Document fallback rules for staging environments (e.g., use production domain in
canonical even on staging).

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Keep Titles ‚â§ 60 Characters

**Why:** Prevent truncation in search results.

### 2. Author One Description Per Page

**Why:** Avoid duplicates; ensure copy matches page intent.

Store copy variations in `docs/content-inventory.md` if available.

---

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Forgetting to Update Favicons

**Problem:** Browsers cache outdated icons.

**Fix:** Version filenames or query params when updating.

### 2. Mixing HTTP/HTTPS

**Problem:** Search engines penalize mixed protocols.

**Fix:** Force HTTPS in canonical URLs.

## üîç Portfolio Pulse Action Items

1. Conduct metadata audit and document findings in `docs/metadata-playbook.md`.
2. Create a canonical/alternate matrix in `notes/module-5-plan.md`.
3. Update `docs/state-architecture.md` with environment override notes (staging,
   preview, production).
4. Share metadata strategy with Avery for confirmation.

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

-  [ ] Metadata playbook includes titles, descriptions, favicons, and canonical
       rules.
-  [ ] Environment override plan documented.
-  [ ] Stakeholder approval logged in notes or retro.
-  [ ] TODOs captured for missing assets or copy.
