# Accessibility & SEO Runbook

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Document an accessibility and SEO audit playbook.
-  [ ] Establish remediation workflows with SLAs and owners.
-  [ ] Align stakeholders on ongoing governance post-launch.

## Why It Matters

Launch is not the finish line. A runbook ensures Portfolio Pulse keeps evolving
without backsliding on accessibility or discoverability.

---

## Runbook Structure

Create `docs/accessibility-seo-runbook.md` with sections:

1. **Audit Cadence** ‚Äî quarterly full checks, monthly spot checks.
2. **Tools** ‚Äî axe DevTools, Lighthouse, WAVE, Screaming Frog, Ahrefs.
3. **Checklists** ‚Äî WCAG 2.2 AA, heading structure, landmark usage, meta tags.
4. **Escalation** ‚Äî how to log issues (Jira/Linear/GitHub) with severity levels.
5. **Sign-off** ‚Äî required approvals for launch or major updates.

## Issue Template

Document a template in the runbook:

```
### Issue Summary
- Impacted page(s):
- Severity (blocker/major/minor):
- Evidence (screenshots/URLs):

### Remediation Plan
- Owner:
- Target fix date:
- Validation steps:
```

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Pair Technical & Content Audits

**Why:** Metadata, headings, and copy all influence SEO and accessibility.

### 2. Track SLAs

**Why:** Ensures high-impact issues get priority treatment.

Log SLAs in `notes/module-5-plan.md` for team visibility.

---

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Treating Accessibility as One-Time

**Problem:** Regressions creep in with new content.

**Fix:** Schedule recurring audits tied to release calendar.

### 2. Ignoring Internationalization

**Problem:** Future localization adds complexity.

**Fix:** Add placeholder guidance for localization checks even if not yet
implemented.

## üîç Portfolio Pulse Action Items

1. Draft the runbook and store it at `docs/accessibility-seo-runbook.md`.
2. Update `docs/accessibility-manifesto.md` with links to the new runbook and
   audit cadence.
3. Log remediation workflow summary in `docs/state-architecture.md` for future
   developers.
4. Capture open questions in `notes/module-5-plan.md` and assign owners.
