# Module 5 Implementation

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Integrate the metadata, structured data, and manifest updates into the
       codebase.
-  [ ] Apply `data-*` instrumentation across critical CTAs.
-  [ ] Sync documentation with final launch details.

## Project Context

This is the final build step before launch. Treat it like a release candidate
where accuracy, accessibility, and governance all converge.

## Head Integration Checklist

1. Update `<title>` and `<meta>` tags per `docs/metadata-playbook.md`.
2. Inject Open Graph, Twitter, and canonical links.
3. Reference `site.webmanifest` and icon set.
4. Append JSON-LD scripts for Person, WebSite, and key case studies.

```html
<link rel="canonical" href="https://avery.dev/" />
<link rel="manifest" href="/site.webmanifest" crossorigin="use-credentials" />
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="/icons/favicon-32.png" />
<script type="application/ld+json">
   {...}
</script>
```

---

## Body Instrumentation

-  Ensure CTA links include `data-cta` and `data-metric-id` values.
-  Tag testimonials, metrics, and highlights with documented IDs.
-  Provide fallback content for offline page links if referenced.

```html
<a
   href="#contact"
   class="cta"
   data-cta="credibility-contact"
   data-track="click"
>
   Partner with Avery
</a>
```

---

## Documentation Sync

-  Update `docs/metadata-playbook.md`, `docs/structured-data.md`,
   `docs/state-architecture.md`, and `docs/validation-log.md` with final
   implementation notes.
-  Cross-link the accessibility & SEO runbook within each doc as needed.

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Stage First

**Why:** Validate metadata and structured data in a preview environment before
production, ensuring canonical URLs still point to prod.

### 2. Pair-Review

**Why:** Metadata errors are subtle; get a second reviewer.

Document sign-off in `notes/module-5-plan.md` or retro logs.

---

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Duplicating JSON-LD Blocks

**Problem:** Multiple Person entries confuse search crawlers.

**Fix:** Consolidate into a single, comprehensive script per entity.

### 2. Forgetting `crossorigin` on Manifest

**Problem:** Favicons and installs fail on some browsers.

**Fix:** Include `crossorigin="use-credentials"` when necessary.

## üî® Implement in Portfolio Pulse

1. Update global layout or `index.html` head with metadata, manifest, and
   JSON-LD.
2. Apply `data-*` instrumentation throughout key sections (hero CTA, gallery,
   contact).
3. Regenerate share images and ensure asset paths match metadata.
4. Sync all documentation and commit with
   `git commit -am "feat: finalize launch metadata"`.

#### Expected Result

Portfolio Pulse's HTML is launch-ready, discoverable, and instrumented for
post-launch analysis.

-  [ ] Manifest and icons load without console errors.

### Accessibility & SEO

-  [ ] Structured data validates with zero errors.
-  [ ] Canonical and social metadata verified via validators.

### Documentation

-  [ ] Governance docs updated with final state.
-  [ ] Stakeholder sign-off recorded for launch.
