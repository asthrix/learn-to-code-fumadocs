# Module 5 Validation

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Verify all launch-critical metadata, structured data, and manifests.
-  [ ] Confirm documentation, approvals, and monitoring plans are complete.
-  [ ] Capture retro notes and backlog items for post-launch improvements.

## Why It Matters

This is the final gate before Portfolio Pulse goes live. Rigorous validation
protects the brand, ensures discoverability, and sets expectations for the next
iteration cycle.

## Launch Audit Checklist

1. **Metadata** ‚Äî Titles, descriptions, canonical, Open Graph, Twitter
   validated.
2. **Structured Data** ‚Äî Rich Results tests pass; screenshots stored.
3. **Manifest & Icons** ‚Äî Installable via Lighthouse; offline fallback
   documented.
4. **Performance** ‚Äî Module 5 audit action items resolved; scores re-run.
5. **Accessibility & SEO** ‚Äî Runbook executed; outstanding issues logged.

Record results in `docs/validation-log.md` under "Module 5 Launch Audit".

## Approvals & Communication

-  Capture stakeholder sign-off in `notes/module-5-retro.md` (create if needed).
-  Update `docs/accessibility-seo-runbook.md` with launch date and next review.
-  Draft launch announcement checklist (email, social, analytics) in
   `docs/metadata-playbook.md` or a new `docs/launch-checklist.md`.

---

## Monitoring Plan

Outline in `docs/state-architecture.md`:

-  Analytics dashboards to watch (traffic, conversions).
-  Error monitoring tools (Sentry, LogRocket) if applicable.
-  Scheduled audits (30-day post-launch check, quarterly maintenance).

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Cold Cache Test

**Why:** Ensures first-time visitors experience the optimized flow.

Open site in Incognito/private window after clearing cache.

### 2. Pair Retro With Launch

**Why:** Fresh context means better insights.

Hold a short retro and record outcomes in `notes/module-5-retro.md`.

---

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Skipping Documentation Updates

**Problem:** Institutional knowledge lives only in chat or memory.

**Fix:** Update every referenced doc before announcing launch.

### 2. No Monitoring Plan

**Problem:** Issues go unnoticed post-launch.

**Fix:** Assign owners for analytics and audits now.

## üîç Portfolio Pulse Audit Scenario

1. Run through the launch audit checklist and capture evidence (screenshots,
   validator links).
2. Present findings to Avery for final approval (async doc or quick call).
3. Update retro notes with risks, wins, and follow-up tasks.
4. Convert open items into tickets with due dates.

#### Expected Result

The portfolio is launch-ready with documentation, approvals, and monitoring in
place.
