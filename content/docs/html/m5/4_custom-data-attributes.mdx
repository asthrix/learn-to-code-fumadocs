# Custom Data Attributes

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Define a naming scheme for Portfolio Pulse `data-*` attributes.
-  [ ] Add attributes that power analytics, personalization, or automation.
-  [ ] Document ownership and change management for each attribute.

## Why It Matters

Custom data attributes bridge static HTML and future interactivity. Planning
them now prevents inconsistent tagging later and supports no-code analytics
integrations.

---

## Naming Convention

Establish rules in `docs/state-architecture.md`:

-  Prefix with namespace: `data-cta`, `data-metric`, `data-track`.
-  Use kebab-case values (`data-cta="credibility-contact"`).
-  Avoid embedding PII; use IDs referencing documentation.

---

## Instrumentation Example

```html
<a
   href="/case-studies/fintech-onboarding.html"
   data-cta="gallery-case-study"
   data-track="click"
   data-metric-id="highlight-001"
>
   Read the case study
</a>
```

Log `data-metric-id` reference in `docs/data-sources.md` so analytics teams can
map it to the correct metric.

## Governance Checklist

Add a table to `docs/state-architecture.md`:

| Attribute        | Purpose                      | Owner       | Notes                        |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| `data-cta`       | Funnel tracking              | Marketing   | Keep values short            |
| `data-metric-id` | Link UI to metrics inventory | You         | References `data-sources.md` |
| `data-component` | Identify UI modules          | Engineering | Optional for A/B tests       |

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Keep Values Stable

**Why:** Analytics dashboards rely on consistent identifiers.

### 2. Document Lifecycle

**Why:** Teams need to know how to add or remove attributes.

Include process steps in `docs/metadata-playbook.md` or a dedicated governance
section.

---

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Embedding Secrets

**Problem:** Sensitive tokens leak into HTML.

**Fix:** Store IDs, not keys or PII.

### 2. Over-Instrumentation

**Problem:** Too many tags overwhelm analytics.

**Fix:** Prioritize primary CTAs and high-value interactions.

## üîç Portfolio Pulse Action Items

1. Draft naming conventions and governance notes in
   `docs/state-architecture.md`.
2. Tag primary CTAs, metrics, and testimonials with `data-*` attributes.
3. Update `docs/data-sources.md` mapping metric IDs to visible content.
4. Record pending analytics integrations in `notes/module-5-plan.md`.

---

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

-  [ ] Data attribute naming scheme documented and approved.
-  [ ] High-value interactions tagged consistently.
-  [ ] Documentation links metrics to UI elements.
-  [ ] Retro log captures open analytics questions.
