# Structured Data

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Generate JSON-LD for Avery (Person), Portfolio Pulse (WebSite), and
       highlighted case studies (CreativeWork).
-  [ ] Embed structured data without breaking caching or templating.
-  [ ] Record update cadence and validation steps.

## Why It Matters

Structured data improves search visibility, eligibility for rich results, and
feeds knowledge panels. It also documents relationships between Avery, clients,
and work.

## JSON-LD Example

```html
<script type="application/ld+json">
   {
      "@context": "https://schema.org",
      "@type": "Person",
      "name": "Avery Rivera",
      "url": "https://avery.dev",
      "jobTitle": "Principal Product Designer",
      "image": "https://avery.dev/images/avery-rivera.jpg",
      "sameAs": [
         "https://www.linkedin.com/in/avery",
         "https://dribbble.com/avery",
         "https://github.com/avery"
      ],
      "worksFor": {
         "@type": "Organization",
         "name": "Rivera Studio"
      }
   }
</script>
```

Add separate script blocks for `WebSite` and `CreativeWork` case studies.

## Documentation

Create `docs/structured-data.md` capturing:

-  Entities covered and their JSON-LD blocks
-  Source of each field (data inventory, social profiles)
-  Refresh cadence (e.g., quarterly check for new case studies)
-  Validation steps using Google Rich Results Test and Schema.org validator

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Use Absolute URLs

**Why:** Schema parsers expect fully qualified links.

### 2. Keep Data DRY

**Why:** Duplicate unsynced data rots quickly.

Reference existing docs (data sources, media inventory) to populate fields.

---

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Embedding HTML in JSON-LD

**Problem:** Invalid JSON leads to parser errors.

### 2. Forgetting to Escape Quotes

**Problem:** Breaks the `<script>` block when templating.

**Fix:** Use JSON formatters or template helpers when available.

## üîç Portfolio Pulse Action Items

1. Author Person, WebSite, and at least one CreativeWork JSON-LD script.
2. Insert scripts near the end of `<head>` or before closing `<body>` per
   tooling constraints.
3. Document snippets and sources in `docs/structured-data.md`.
4. Capture validation results in `docs/validation-log.md` with links to Rich
   Results tests.

---

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

-  [ ] JSON-LD passes Google Rich Results Test with zero errors.
-  [ ] Structured data documentation updated with fields and cadence.
-  [ ] Scripts use absolute URLs and reference current data.
-  [ ] Stakeholder approval recorded for public client mentions.
