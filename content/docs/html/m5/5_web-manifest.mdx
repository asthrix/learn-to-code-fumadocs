# Web App Manifest

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Configure `site.webmanifest` with accurate metadata and icons.
-  [ ] Set theme and background colors that complement Portfolio Pulse branding.
-  [ ] Plan offline fallback HTML for limited connectivity scenarios.

## Why It Matters

A manifest enables add-to-home-screen experiences and influences how Portfolio
Pulse appears on mobile launchers. Even without full service workers, polished
metadata improves perceived quality.

## Manifest Template

```json
{
   "name": "Portfolio Pulse ‚Äî Avery Rivera",
   "short_name": "Avery Rivera",
   "start_url": "/?utm_source=install",
   "display": "standalone",
   "background_color": "#0f172a",
   "theme_color": "#e879f9",
   "description": "Product design leader helping teams ship inclusive experiences that convert.",
   "icons": [
      { "src": "/icons/icon-192.png", "sizes": "192x192", "type": "image/png" },
      { "src": "/icons/icon-512.png", "sizes": "512x512", "type": "image/png" },
      {
         "src": "/icons/maskable-192.png",
         "sizes": "192x192",
         "type": "image/png",
         "purpose": "maskable"
      }
   ]
}
```

Update `/app/site.webmanifest` (or equivalent) to match decisions logged in
`docs/metadata-playbook.md`.

## Offline Fallback Plan

Even if service workers are future work, prepare an offline HTML page:

-  Create `public/offline.html` with messaging and contact email.
-  Link to it from documentation so engineers can connect service workers later.
-  Document desired offline behavior in `docs/state-architecture.md`.

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Include Maskable Icons

**Why:** Android devices crop icons; maskable assets prevent clipping.

### 2. Align Theme Colors With CSS Variables

**Why:** Maintains consistent brand experience across browsers.

Document the chosen colors in `docs/style-tokens.md` if available.

---

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Leaving Default Manifest Values

**Problem:** Generic names reduce trust.

### 2. Forgetting `start_url`

**Problem:** Users land on cached versions without analytics tracking.

**Fix:** Include UTM parameters to identify app-launch sessions.

## üîç Portfolio Pulse Action Items

1. Audit existing manifest and update fields and icons.
2. Generate maskable and standard icons using brand assets.
3. Document offline fallback requirements and links in
   `docs/state-architecture.md`.
4. Record manifest decisions in `docs/metadata-playbook.md` for governance.

---

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

-  [ ] Manifest passes Lighthouse PWA checks (Installable section).
-  [ ] Icons generated at required sizes and stored in `public/icons/`.
-  [ ] Offline fallback plan documented with next steps.
-  [ ] Stakeholder approval captured for branding updates.
