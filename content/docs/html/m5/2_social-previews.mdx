# Social Previews

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Configure Open Graph and Twitter Card metadata for Portfolio Pulse.
-  [ ] Produce performant share images in multiple aspect ratios.
-  [ ] Validate previews using platform debugging tools.

## Why It Matters

Share cards are often your first impression. Misconfigured metadata leads to
blurry images, broken descriptions, or zero engagement on social platforms.

## Core Metadata Block

```html
<meta property="og:type" content="website" />
<meta property="og:title" content="Avery Rivera ¬∑ Product Design Leader" />
<meta
   property="og:description"
   content="Product designer helping teams ship inclusive experiences that convert."
/>
<meta property="og:url" content="https://avery.dev/" />
<meta
   property="og:image"
   content="https://avery.dev/social/portfolio-pulse-1200x630.jpg"
/>
<meta property="og:image:width" content="1200" />
<meta property="og:image:height" content="630" />
<meta property="og:locale" content="en_US" />

<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image" />
<meta name="twitter:title" content="Avery Rivera ¬∑ Product Design Leader" />
<meta
   name="twitter:description"
   content="Product designer helping teams ship inclusive experiences that convert."
/>
<meta
   name="twitter:image"
   content="https://avery.dev/social/portfolio-pulse-1200x600.jpg"
/>
<meta name="twitter:creator" content="@averydesigns" />
```

Use absolute URLs to prevent crawler confusion.

## Share Image Production

Export at least two variants:

| Platform   | Dimensions | Max Size | Notes                  |
| ---------- | ---------- | -------- | ---------------------- |
| Open Graph | 1200√ó630   | ‚â§ 400 KB | Use PNG for sharp text |
| Twitter    | 1200√ó600   | ‚â§ 5 MB   | Keep safe area margins |

Store files in `public/social/` and document filenames in
`docs/metadata-playbook.md`.

---

## Validation Workflow

-  Facebook Sharing Debugger
-  LinkedIn Post Inspector
-  X (Twitter) Card Validator
-  Slack block kit builder (for internal previews)

Record validation screenshots and notes in `docs/validation-log.md` under
Module 5.

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Localize Copy Where Needed

**Why:** Social posts adapt to different markets.

Document localized strings in `docs/content-inventory.md` for future use.

### 2. Version Share Images

**Why:** Cached images stick around.

Add query params like `?v=2025-10` when updating assets.

---

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Mixing Relative URLs

**Problem:** Crawlers resolve incorrectly and return 404.

### 2. Forgetting `og:type`

**Problem:** Some networks default to `article`, altering layout.

**Fix:** Set `website` for landing pages or `article` for posts intentionally.

## üîç Portfolio Pulse Action Items

1. Add Open Graph and Twitter metadata to the site head template.
2. Export share images aligned with brand guidelines.
3. Document asset locations and update cadence in `docs/metadata-playbook.md`.
4. Log validator screenshots and follow-ups in `docs/validation-log.md`.

-  [ ] Open Graph and Twitter metadata present with absolute URLs.
-  [ ] Share images optimized and documented.
-  [ ] Validation logs updated with tool screenshots.
-  [ ] Stakeholder approval recorded in notes.
