# Module 5 · Advanced HTML5 & Production Polish

Module 5 prepares Portfolio Pulse for prime time. You will enrich metadata for
sharing, add structured data for rich results, wire analytics-friendly data
attributes, and run a full launch audit across performance, accessibility, and
SEO.

### What You Will Deliver

-  Comprehensive metadata covering Open Graph, Twitter, and canonical strategy.
-  Structured data snippets (JSON-LD) for person, organization, and article
   experiences.
-  Custom data attributes and manifests that future-proof analytics and offline
   readiness.
-  A documented launch audit with remediation plan and retro notes.

### Lesson Map

1. **Metadata Strategy** — define canonical URLs, favicons, and environment
   overrides.
2. **Social Previews** — implement Open Graph and Twitter Card metadata with
   validation workflows.
3. **Structured Data** — add JSON-LD for Person, Organization, and CreativeWork.
4. **Custom Data Attributes** — wire analytics and automation-friendly markup.
5. **Web App Manifest** — configure icons, colors, and offline fallbacks for
   installable experiences.
6. **Performance Audits** — run Lighthouse, WebPageTest, and Core Web Vitals
   diagnostics.
7. **Accessibility & SEO Runbook** — consolidate audit flows and remediation
   templates.
8. **Implementation** — integrate metadata, structured data, and manifests into
   Portfolio Pulse.
9. **Validation** — finalize launch checklist, documentation, and stakeholder
   sign-off.

Bring your project brief, validation logs, accessibility manifesto, and data
source documentation. You will extend each with launch governance notes and
post-launch monitoring plans.
