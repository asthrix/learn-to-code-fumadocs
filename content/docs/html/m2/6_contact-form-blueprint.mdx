# Contact Form Blueprint

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Finalize the form field inventory and groupings.
-  [ ] Define consent and privacy disclosures compliant with regulations.
-  [ ] Decide how submissions will be processed and stored.
-  [ ] Create a blueprint table that guides implementation.

## Project Context

Before writing the full markup, commit to the exact form you will ship. This
blueprint becomes the contract for stakeholders and informs future automation or
backend work.

## Field Inventory

### Core Groups

1. **Contact Details:** Name, email, optional phone.
2. **Project Context:** Project type, timeline, budget range.
3. **Message:** Freeform text area.
4. **Consent:** Marketing opt-in, privacy acknowledgement.

### Consent & Privacy

Include explicit consent for marketing communications and link to privacy
policies. For EU visitors, note GDPR compliance.

### Basic Example

```md
| Field             | Type     | Required | Notes                    |
| ----------------- | -------- | -------- | ------------------------ |
| name              | text     | yes      | Autocomplete name        |
| email             | email    | yes      | Primary contact          |
| project-type      | select   | yes      | Options defined in brief |
| message           | textarea | yes      | Minimum 50 characters    |
| marketing-consent | checkbox | no       | Default unchecked        |
```

### Practical Example

```md
# Contact Form Blueprint

## Field Groups

1. Contact details
   -  Name (text, required)
   -  Work email (email, required)
   -  Phone (tel, optional)
2. Project context
   -  Engagement type (select, required)
   -  Estimated budget (number, optional)
   -  Target launch (date, optional)
3. Message
   -  Project summary (textarea, required, min 50 chars)
4. Consent
   -  Privacy acknowledgment (checkbox, required)
   -  Marketing opt-in (checkbox, optional)

## Submission Handling

-  Primary channel: Send email via serverless function (Resend or AWS SES)
-  CRM: Zapier integration to Airtable leads table
-  Auto-response: Send templated email acknowledging receipt

## Analytics Hooks

-  Trigger `form_submit` event on successful send
-  Trigger `form_error` with error codes for debugging
```

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Keep Consent Checkboxes Separate

**Why:** Privacy acknowledgment and marketing consent serve different legal
purposes.

```html
<label>
   <input type="checkbox" name="privacy" required />
   I agree to the privacy policy.
</label>
<label>
   <input type="checkbox" name="marketing-consent" />
   Send me occasional updates.
</label>
```

### 2. Provide Links to Privacy Policy Next to Consent

**Why:** Users should access policies when making a decision.

```html
<a href="/legal/privacy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Privacy policy</a>
```

---

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Combining Consent into a Single Checkbox

**Problem:** Blending legal acknowledgment and marketing opt-in leads to
compliance issues.

```html
<input type="checkbox" required /> I agree to privacy and marketing.
```

**Solution:**

```html
<input type="checkbox" name="privacy" required /> I agree to privacy policy.
<input type="checkbox" name="marketing-consent" /> Send updates.
```

### 2. Ignoring Backend Constraints

**Problem:** Collecting data that backend systems cannot store results in lost
submissions.

```md
// Bad: capturing budget as text when CRM expects numeric value.
```

**Solution:**

```md
-  Field: Budget
-  Type: Number (stored as integer in CRM)
```

## üî® Implement in Portfolio Pulse

### Task: Document the Blueprint

1. Update `docs/form-strategy.md` with a table like the practical example.
2. Note submission handling plan (email service, CRM, auto-response).
3. Capture consent language referencing the privacy policy.
4. Commit with `git commit -am "docs: finalize contact form blueprint"`.

#### Expected Result

You have a clear, approved specification that developers and stakeholders can
rely on when implementing the form.
