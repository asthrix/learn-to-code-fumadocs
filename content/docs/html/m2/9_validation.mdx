# Module 2 Validation

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Validate the contact form across desktop and mobile.
-  [ ] Confirm accessibility expectations (labels, hints, errors).
-  [ ] Document findings in validation logs and retro notes.
-  [ ] Ensure analytics and consent tracking are ready for launch.

## Why This Matters

Lead capture is one of the most sensitive flows in your site. Any friction or
accessibility gap can cost you opportunities. A thorough validation round
protects the experience before the next module.

---

## Validation Process

### 1. Manual Checks

-  Navigate the form using only the keyboard.
-  Test the `tab` order, ensuring skip link lands at the form.
-  Trigger each validation state and confirm the correct message appears.

### 2. Accessibility Audits

-  Run Lighthouse (accessibility category) in Chrome; expect 95+ score.
-  Use axe DevTools or tota11y to verify label relationships and error handling.
-  Confirm ARIA attributes (`aria-describedby`, `role="status"`) function as
   expected.

### 3. Browser & Device

-  Desktop: Chrome, Firefox, Safari.
-  Mobile: iOS Safari, Android Chrome (responsive mode acceptable if devices
   unavailable).

### 4. Documentation Updates

-  `docs/form-strategy.md`: Record any copy or flow adjustments.
-  `docs/state-architecture.md`: Document how you reset error states on success.
-  `notes/module-2-retro.md` (create if absent): Capture what worked, pain
   points, and next steps.

### 5. Analytics & Consent Checks

-  Confirm placeholder data layer events exist for submissions.
-  Ensure consent checkbox states are passed through `FormData`.

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Test Real Inputs

**Why:** Sample data exposes formatting issues and context-specific problems.

```text
Budget: 4,500
Message: Launching a redesign in Q3, need UX audit + roadmap.
```

### 2. Break Things on Purpose

**Why:** Validating resilience ensures graceful failure states.

```text
- Disable JavaScript and submit (should still post)
- Turn off network mid-submit (status message should fail gracefully)
```

---

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Only Testing Happy Paths

**Problem:** Edge cases slip into production.

```text
Never triggers error state for required checkbox.
```

**Fix:**

-  Attempt submission with consent unchecked.
-  Confirm inline error appears and focus moves to the checkbox.

### 2. Skipping Documentation

**Problem:** Team cannot trace decisions.

```text
No entry in validation log; future audits restart from scratch.
```

**Fix:**

-  Record checklist results in `docs/validation-log.md`.
-  Note bug tickets or follow-up tasks.

## üîç Audit Scenario: Portfolio Pulse

### Validate the Contact Form Flow

1. Use Chrome and Safari to test submissions with valid and invalid inputs.
2. Navigate using keyboard only; verify focus order and visual indicators.
3. Run Lighthouse ‚Üí Accessibility report ‚Üí record score in
   `docs/validation-log.md`.
4. Update `notes/module-2-retro.md` with highlights and risks.
5. Create tickets for any issues you cannot resolve immediately.

#### Expected Result

You have documented evidence of the form‚Äôs quality and a clear plan for
follow-up work.

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

### Accessibility

-  [ ] Lighthouse accessibility score ‚â• 95.
-  [ ] Screen reader announces errors and success messages.

### Functionality

-  [ ] Required fields prevent submission until resolved.
-  [ ] Consent states persist in submitted data.

### Documentation

-  [ ] Validation log updated with Module 2 findings.
-  [ ] Retro notes captured with action items.

### Analytics & Consent

-  [ ] Analytics instrumentation documented or stubbed.
-  [ ] Consent policy reference confirmed in UI copy.

## Next Steps

-  Review Module 2 retro notes to identify improvements for upcoming modules.
-  Prepare for Module 3 by outlining how HTML structure supports dynamic
   content.
