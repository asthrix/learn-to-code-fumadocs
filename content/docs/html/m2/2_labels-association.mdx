# Label Association & Instructions

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Associate form controls with visible labels.
-  [ ] Connect hints and error messages using `aria-describedby`.
-  [ ] Provide contextual instructions that reduce friction.
-  [ ] Create reusable label components for future forms.

## Project Context

Labels and instructions are the backbone of accessible forms. They allow screen
reader users to understand what information is required and why. Portfolio Pulse
aims to convert busy professionals, so clarity drives completion rates.

## Associating Labels with Inputs

### `label` + `for` Pattern

Use `<label for="field-id">` with matching `id` on the input. This ensures focus
and announcements align.

### Hints and Help Text

Use `<p id="field-hint">` and reference via `aria-describedby` for additional
context.

### Basic Example

```html
<label for="name">Your name</label>
<input id="name" name="name" type="text" required />
```

### Practical Example

```html
<div class="form-field">
   <label for="project-type">Which engagement are you exploring?</label>
   <p id="project-type-hint" class="form-hint">
      Choose the option that best matches your current need.
   </p>
   <select
      id="project-type"
      name="project-type"
      aria-describedby="project-type-hint"
      required
   >
      <option value="">Select...</option>
      <option value="audit">UX audit & accessibility review</option>
      <option value="sprint">Design sprint</option>
      <option value="retainer">Product discovery engagement</option>
   </select>
</div>
```

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Keep Labels Visible

**Why:** Placeholder-only forms disappear when users start typing and fail
accessibility.

```html
<label for="email">Work email</label>
<input id="email" name="email" type="email" placeholder="you@company.com" />
```

### 2. Group Related Controls with Fieldsets

**Why:** `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` convey relationships between controls
(e.g., radio groups).

```html
<fieldset>
   <legend>Preferred meeting slots</legend>
   <label><input type="radio" name="meeting" value="morning" /> Morning</label>
   <label
      ><input type="radio" name="meeting" value="afternoon" /> Afternoon</label
   >
</fieldset>
```

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Relying on Placeholder as Label

**Problem:** Placeholders vanish as soon as the user types, causing confusion.

```html
<input type="text" placeholder="Your name" />
```

**Solution:**

```html
<label for="name">Your name</label> <input id="name" name="name" type="text" />
```

### 2. Forgetting to Update `aria-describedby`

**Problem:** Removing hints without updating references leaves broken ARIA
relationships.

```html
<select aria-describedby="project-type-hint">
   ...
</select>
<!-- but the hint element was deleted -->
```

**Solution:**

```html
Ensure referenced hint IDs exist and remain unique.
```

## üî® Implement in Portfolio Pulse

### Task: Scaffold Labeled Fields

1. Add labeled input fields for name, email, and project type in `index.html`
   inside the `#contact` section.
2. Provide hint text and use `aria-describedby` for additional instructions.
3. Document label patterns in `docs/form-strategy.md` under a "UI Patterns"
   heading.
4. Commit with `git commit -am "feat: add labeled contact fields"`.

#### Expected Result

Your contact section now includes clearly labeled fields that set expectations
and support assistive technologies.

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

### Functionality

-  [ ] Each input has a visible label connected via `for`/`id`.
-  [ ] Hint text is referenced with `aria-describedby` where applicable.

### Code Quality

-  [ ] Fieldsets wrap radio or checkbox groups.
-  [ ] IDs follow consistent naming (kebab or camel case).

### Understanding

-  [ ] You can explain why placeholders are not a substitute for labels.
-  [ ] You know when to use `aria-describedby` vs `aria-labelledby`.

### Project Integration

-  [ ] Form strategy references the label patterns and IDs.
-  [ ] Accessibility manifesto includes form labelling considerations.
