# Module 2 · Forms & Lead Capture

Module 2 upgrades Portfolio Pulse from an informational site to a
lead-generating machine. You will design an accessible contact form, provide
inline feedback, and capture consent responsibly. The goal: a frictionless
experience that respects user privacy.

### What You Will Deliver

-  A contact form with labels, instructions, validation, and success states.
-  Accessible error messaging with ARIA live regions.
-  Consent and privacy disclosures aligned with regulations.
-  Documentation covering form submission, handling, and analytics needs.

### Lesson Map

1. **Forms Introduction** — connect business goals to form strategy.
2. **Labels & Association** — ensure every field is discoverable and announced
   correctly.
3. **Input Types** — leverage HTML5 inputs and attributes for better UX.
4. **Validation Strategies** — combine native validation with progressive
   enhancement.
5. **Accessible Feedback** — deliver inline errors and confirmations that
   assistive tech understands.
6. **Contact Form Blueprint** — map fields, consent checkboxes, and success
   flows.
7. **Form Enhancements** — add extras like honeypots, loading states, and
   analytics hooks.
8. **Implementation** — build the production-ready form.
9. **Validation** — audit accessibility, security, and privacy compliance.

Keep your project brief and accessibility manifesto handy; you will extend both
with lead capture requirements.
