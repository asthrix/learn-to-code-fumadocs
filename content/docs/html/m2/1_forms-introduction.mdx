# Lead Capture Strategy

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Clarify the primary and secondary goals of Portfolio Pulse forms.
-  [ ] Map visitor intents to required and optional fields.
-  [ ] Balance friction and conversion using progressive disclosure.
-  [ ] Document success metrics and analytics events.

## Project Context

Forms are the bridge between interest and action. Without a thoughtful plan you
risk collecting the wrong data, overwhelming visitors, or violating privacy
expectations. A strategic foundation ensures later implementation meets legal
requirements and business goals.

---

## Defining Purpose and Intent

### Primary Goal

Portfolio Pulse aims to schedule discovery calls. The form should prioritize
information that enables a tailored conversation.

### Secondary Goals

-  Capture newsletter opt-ins for ongoing nurture.
-  Collect project timelines to manage pipeline.

### Basic Example

```md
Primary goal: Book a discovery call Success metric: 5 qualified submissions per
month Secondary metric: Newsletter opt-in rate > 40%
```

### Practical Example

```md
# Form Strategy

## Visitor Intents

1. Hiring manager seeking collaboration ‚Üí needs quick response
2. Founder exploring a redesign ‚Üí wants clarity on services
3. Recruiter browsing portfolio ‚Üí mostly needs contact details

## Required Fields

-  Name
-  Email
-  Project context (dropdown)
-  Budget range (optional but helpful)
-  Preferred meeting date/time (optional)

## Analytics Events

-  `form_view`
-  `form_submit`
-  `form_error`
-  `form_success`
```

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Ask for the Minimum Data Required

**Why:** Fewer required fields improve conversion and respect visitor time.

```md
Required ‚Üí Name, Email, Project type Optional ‚Üí Company, Timeline, Budget
```

### 2. Provide Context for Each Field

**Why:** Explaining why you ask for information builds trust.

```html
<label for="project-type">What are you exploring?</label>
<p id="project-type-hint" class="form-hint">
   This helps us route your request to the right workflow.
</p>
<select id="project-type" aria-describedby="project-type-hint">
   ...
</select>
```

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Copying Generic Forms

**Problem:** Generic templates collect irrelevant data and hurt conversion.

```html
<!-- Bad: asking for address for a discovery call -->
<label for="address">Address</label>
<input id="address" name="address" type="text" />
```

**Solution:**

```html
<label for="project-type">What are you exploring?</label>
<select id="project-type" name="project-type">
   ...
</select>
```

### 2. Ignoring Privacy Requirements

**Problem:** Collecting personal data without consent disclosures risks legal
issues.

```html
<!-- Bad: no checkbox for marketing consent -->
```

**Solution:**

```html
<label>
   <input type="checkbox" name="marketing-consent" />
   I agree to receive occasional updates.
</label>
```

## üî® Implement in Portfolio Pulse

### Task: Draft the Form Strategy

1. Create `docs/form-strategy.md` summarizing goals, visitor intents, required
   fields, optional fields, and success metrics.
2. Record analytics events you plan to track after launch.
3. Capture privacy and consent considerations, linking to policies.
4. Commit with `git commit -am "docs: define portfolio form strategy"`.

#### Expected Result

You have a strategic guide that informs every markup decision in Module 2.
