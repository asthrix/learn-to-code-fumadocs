# Planning Landmarks & Page Regions

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Assign each major section of Portfolio Pulse to the correct landmark.
-  [ ] Determine when to use `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, or `<div>`.
-  [ ] Document focus order and skip link targets across the page.
-  [ ] Create a region inventory that guides designers and developers.

## Project Context

Landmarks shape the mental model of your site. When you intentionally assign
them, you help screen reader users jump to relevant sections, ensure search
engines understand context, and make collaboration easier because everyone
references the same region names.

## Landmark Assignments

### Header & Navigation

Use `<header role="banner">` for the top region, containing logo, navigation,
and call-to-action. If the navigation is complex, consider a secondary
`<nav aria-label="Secondary">` inside the footer.

### Main

`<main>` should contain the primary narrative: hero, highlights, services,
testimonials, contact. Only one `main` per page.

### Aside

Use `<aside>` for supplemental content such as credentials, press logos, or
quick stats. The content should be related but not central to the main
narrative.

### Footer

`<footer>` provides supporting navigation, legal links, and final calls to
action.

### Basic Example

```html
<body>
   <header role="banner">...</header>
   <main>
      <section>...</section>
      <aside aria-label="Quick facts">...</aside>
   </main>
   <footer role="contentinfo">...</footer>
</body>
```

### Practical Example

```html
<header class="site-header" role="banner">
   <div class="brand">Portfolio Pulse</div>
   <nav aria-label="Primary navigation">...</nav>
</header>
<main id="main-content" tabindex="-1">
   <section id="hero" aria-labelledby="hero-heading">...</section>
   <section id="projects" aria-labelledby="projects-heading">...</section>
   <section id="services" aria-labelledby="services-title">...</section>
   <aside aria-label="Credentials">
      <h2>Credentials</h2>
      <p>Certified UX Leader ¬∑ 8+ years shipping products</p>
   </aside>
   <section id="contact" aria-labelledby="contact-title">...</section>
</main>
<footer class="site-footer" role="contentinfo">...</footer>
```

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Name Asides for Context

**Why:** Adding `aria-label` clarifies how supplemental content relates to the
main narrative.

```html
<aside aria-label="Testimonials sidebar">...</aside>
```

### 2. Document Focus Order

**Why:** Knowing where focus moves allows you to test keyboard navigation and
plan interactive elements.

```md
Focus order:

1. Skip link
2. Primary navigation items
3. Hero call-to-action
4. Case study cards
5. Contact form
```

---

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Using `<aside>` for Core Content

**Problem:** If content is critical (services, case studies), it belongs in
`<section>` inside `<main>`.

```html
<!-- Bad: entire services section inside aside -->
<aside>
   <h2>Services</h2>
   ...
</aside>
```

**Solution:**

```html
<section id="services">...</section>
```

### 2. Duplicating Landmarks

**Problem:** Multiple `<footer>` elements confuse assistive technologies.

```html
<footer>Primary footer</footer>
<footer>Secondary info</footer>
```

**Solution:**

```html
<footer>
   <section aria-label="Secondary info">...</section>
</footer>
```

## üî® Implement in Portfolio Pulse

### Task: Build the Region Inventory

1. Update `docs/layout-plan.md` with a table mapping sections to landmarks,
   headings, IDs, and notes.
2. Annotate `index.html` with comments describing the purpose of each region
   (helpful for collaborators).
3. Ensure `aside` usage fits the supplemental criteria; move critical content
   into `<section>` if needed.
4. Commit with `git commit -am "docs: finalize landmark inventory"`.

#### Expected Result

Your team can glance at the layout plan and know exactly how the page is
structured and how focus should move.

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

### Functionality

-  [ ] Each landmark appears once and wraps the correct content.
-  [ ] `aside` regions contain supplemental‚Äînot primary‚Äîcontent.

### Code Quality

-  [ ] Comments in `index.html` reflect the latest region inventory.
-  [ ] Layout plan table includes headings, IDs, and responsibilities.

### Understanding

-  [ ] You can justify why each section uses its selected HTML element.
-  [ ] You know how focus should move through the page.

### Project Integration

-  [ ] Region inventory is linked from the project brief.
-  [ ] Notes include any open dependencies for supplemental content.
