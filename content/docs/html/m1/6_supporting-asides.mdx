# Designing Supporting Asides

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Determine which content belongs in `<aside>` versus `<section>`.
-  [ ] Create semantic markup for credentials, press mentions, and quick stats.
-  [ ] Connect asides to main content using ARIA or headings.
-  [ ] Plan how asides adapt for mobile layouts.

## Project Context

Asides provide supporting information without overshadowing the main story.
Portfolio Pulse can use them to emphasise credibility, share press quotes, or
show availability. Well-crafted asides reinforce the narrative while staying
accessible and responsive.

## What Belongs in an Aside?

-  Press logos and quotes referencing your work
-  Certifications or awards that support the case studies
-  Quick stats (years of experience, shipped products)
-  Availability or contact reminders

### Basic Example

```html
<aside aria-label="Press mentions">
   <h2>Featured In</h2>
   <ul>
      <li><span aria-hidden="true">üóûÔ∏è</span> Product Weekly</li>
      <li><span aria-hidden="true">üéôÔ∏è</span> Design Ops Radio</li>
   </ul>
</aside>
```

### Practical Example

```html
<aside class="sidebar" aria-labelledby="sidebar-credentials">
   <h2 id="sidebar-credentials">Credentials & Press</h2>
   <section aria-labelledby="quick-stats">
      <h3 id="quick-stats">Quick stats</h3>
      <dl class="stat-list">
         <div>
            <dt>Experience</dt>
            <dd><time datetime="2015">10 years</time></dd>
         </div>
         <div>
            <dt>Shipped products</dt>
            <dd>24 end-to-end engagements</dd>
         </div>
      </dl>
   </section>
   <section aria-labelledby="press-highlights">
      <h3 id="press-highlights">Press highlights</h3>
      <ul class="press-list">
         <li>
            <a
               href="https://example.com/product-weekly"
               rel="noopener"
               target="_blank"
            >
               Product Weekly ¬∑ Designing with accessible defaults
            </a>
         </li>
         <li>
            <a
               href="https://example.com/design-ops-radio"
               rel="noopener"
               target="_blank"
            >
               Design Ops Radio ¬∑ From prototypes to production
            </a>
         </li>
      </ul>
   </section>
</aside>
```

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Use `<dl>` for Stat Blocks

**Why:** Definition lists pair labels with values, improving screen reader
output.

```html
<dl>
   <div>
      <dt>Active clients</dt>
      <dd>3 retainer partnerships</dd>
   </div>
</dl>
```

### 2. Provide Contextual Headings

**Why:** Headings make asides discoverable via screen reader shortcuts.

```html
<aside aria-labelledby="availability-title">
   <h2 id="availability-title">Availability</h2>
   <p>Booking new projects for Q2 2026.</p>
</aside>
```

---

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Dumping Unrelated Content

**Problem:** Asides should be related to the surrounding content; otherwise they
confuse users.

```html
<aside>
   <h2>Blog posts</h2>
   <!-- unrelated to case studies -->
</aside>
```

**Solution:**

```html
<aside aria-label="Credentials supporting case studies">...</aside>
```

### 2. Forgetting External Link Attributes

**Problem:** Press links should open in a new tab and use `rel="noopener"` for
security.

```html
<a href="https://example.com">Read article</a>
```

**Solution:**

```html
<a href="https://example.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read article</a>
```

## üî® Implement in Portfolio Pulse

### Task: Add Supporting Asides

1. Insert the practical example (customized) into `index.html`, positioning the
   aside near case studies.
2. Ensure each section within the aside has a heading and semantic structure
   (`<dl>`, `<ul>`).
3. Log any missing resources (press URLs, updated stats) in
   `notes/retro-log.md`.
4. Commit with `git commit -am "feat: add supporting asides"`.

#### Expected Result

Portfolio Pulse now features supplemental information that reinforces
credibility without interrupting the main narrative.

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

### Functionality

-  [ ] Aside is reachable via keyboard navigation and skip links.
-  [ ] External links include `rel="noopener"` and open as expected.

### Code Quality

-  [ ] `<dl>` groups stats with `<dt>` and `<dd>` pairs.
-  [ ] Headings exist for each subsection inside the aside.

### Understanding

-  [ ] You can explain why the aside content supports nearby sections.
-  [ ] You know what additional data sources are needed.

### Project Integration

-  [ ] Retro log lists pending assets and approvals.
-  [ ] Layout plan references the aside and its purpose.
