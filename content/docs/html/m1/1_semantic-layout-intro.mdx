# Semantic Layout Strategy

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Distinguish between structural landmarks and sectioning elements.
-  [ ] Map the Portfolio Pulse narrative to HTML5 semantics.
-  [ ] Create a layout sketch that informs upcoming implementation.
-  [ ] Document decisions that impact accessibility and SEO.

## Project Context

You already have a baseline page. Now you need to articulate how each section
works together. Strategic layout decisions help designers layer visuals,
developers integrate components, and content strategists maintain the story
without breaking semantics.

## Landmarks vs Sectioning Elements

### Landmarks

Landmarks (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`) provide global
structure. Screen readers let users jump between landmarks quickly, so choose
them carefully.

### Sectioning Elements

Sectioning elements (`<section>`, `<article>`, `<div>`, `<figure>`) create
subsections inside landmarks. They reset heading hierarchies and allow you to
group related content.

### Basic Example

```html
<body>
   <header role="banner">...</header>
   <main>
      <section id="hero">...</section>
      <section id="highlights">...</section>
   </main>
   <footer role="contentinfo">...</footer>
</body>
```

### Practical Example

```html
<body>
   <header class="site-header" role="banner">
      <nav aria-label="Primary navigation">...</nav>
   </header>
   <main id="main-content" tabindex="-1">
      <section id="hero" aria-labelledby="hero-heading">...</section>
      <section id="projects" aria-labelledby="projects-heading">
         <header>
            <h2 id="projects-heading">Flagship Case Studies</h2>
            <p class="section-subtitle">
               Proof that measurable outcomes are possible.
            </p>
         </header>
         <div class="case-study-grid">...</div>
      </section>
      <aside aria-label="Quick credentials">...</aside>
   </main>
   <footer class="site-footer" role="contentinfo">...</footer>
</body>
```

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Sketch the Layout Before Coding

**Why:** A quick wireframe clarifies hierarchy and reduces rework.

```md
[Header]

-  Logo + navigation + call-to-action [Main]
-  Hero
-  Case studies
-  Services overview
-  Testimonials
-  Contact form [Footer]
-  Secondary navigation
-  Contact info
-  Legal links
```

### 2. Use Section Headings Strategically

**Why:** Clear headings let assistive technologies announce sections naturally.

```html
<section id="services" aria-labelledby="services-title">
   <h2 id="services-title">Ways we can collaborate</h2>
   ...
</section>
```

---

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Overusing `<section>` Without Headings

**Problem:** Sections without headings confuse screen readers and create empty
outline nodes.

```html
<section>
   <p>We offer design sprints and product audits.</p>
</section>
```

**Solution:**

```html
<section aria-labelledby="services-title">
   <h2 id="services-title">Services</h2>
   <p>We offer design sprints and product audits.</p>
</section>
```

### 2. Nesting Landmarks Improperly

**Problem:** Placing a `<header>` inside another `<header>` breaks expected
document structure.

```html
<header>
   <header>Logo</header>
</header>
```

**Solution:**

```html
<header>
   <div class="logo">Logo</div>
</header>
```

## üî® Implement in Portfolio Pulse

### Task: Document the Layout Strategy

1. Add `docs/layout-plan.md` outlining landmarks, sections, headings, and anchor
   IDs.
2. Include a simple ASCII wireframe or bullet list to describe the layout order.
3. Note any dependencies (final case study copy, testimonials) with owners.
4. Commit with `git commit -am "docs: capture semantic layout strategy"`.

#### Expected Result

You now have a living document that keeps markup aligned with the narrative and
aids collaborators who join mid-project.

## Notes

-  Keep aside optional for quick credential highlights.
-  Update layout plan once case studies expand beyond three.

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

### Functionality

-  [ ] Layout plan references all sections currently in `index.html`.
-  [ ] Landmarks are identified with roles or native semantics.

### Code Quality

-  [ ] Heading levels remain consistent in the plan.
-  [ ] Dependencies include owners or due dates.

### Understanding

-  [ ] You can explain the difference between landmarks and sectioning elements.
-  [ ] You know which sections require additional content.

### Project Integration

-  [ ] Layout plan is linked from the project brief.
-  [ ] Notes capture any open questions about future pages or sections.
