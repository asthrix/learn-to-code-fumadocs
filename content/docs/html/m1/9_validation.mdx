# Module 1 Validation

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Audit the Module 1 layout using automated and manual techniques.
-  [ ] Capture findings with severity ratings.
-  [ ] Confirm navigation and layout behaviors meet accessibility requirements.
-  [ ] Define next steps for Module 2.

## Project Context

Validation ensures your semantic layout is production-worthy. Before moving to
forms, confirm the core narrative is structurally sound. This step also
reassures stakeholders that the project stays aligned with standards.

## Audit Focus Areas

### Automated Tools

-  axe DevTools for landmark, heading, and ARIA issues
-  HTML5 Outliner or browser accessibility tree for heading structure
-  Link checker to ensure all anchors resolve

### Manual Checks

-  Keyboard navigation through header, sections, and footer
-  Screen reader review of landmarks (VoiceOver, NVDA)
-  Visual scan for duplicate links or inconsistent copy

### Basic Example

```md
## Module 1 Validation Notes

-  ‚úÖ axe DevTools: No violations
-  ‚ö†Ô∏è Outliner: Hero uses two h1 elements (fixed)
-  ‚úÖ Links: All anchors resolved to sections
```

### Practical Example

```md
# Module 1 ¬∑ Validation Summary

## Automated Checks

-  HTML Validator: 0 errors, 0 warnings
-  axe DevTools: 1 warning (duplicate link text "Book a call" resolved by adding
   context)

## Manual Review

-  Keyboard navigation: Pass (skip link visible, menu toggle accessible)
-  Screen reader landmark review: Pass (header, navigation, main, aside, footer
   detected)

## Backlog

-  Replace placeholder testimonial copy (owner: Avery, due Module 3)
-  Consolidate duplicate nav lists using partials (owner: Avery, due Module 4)
```

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Pair Automated and Manual Testing

**Why:** Automated tools catch structural issues, while manual reviews uncover
contextual problems.

```md
-  Automated: axe, html-validate
-  Manual: keyboard, screen reader, print preview
```

### 2. Assign Owners and Deadlines

**Why:** Documenting who will resolve issues prevents backlog stagnation.

```md
-  Issue: Placeholder testimonial
-  Owner: Avery
-  Due: Module 3 Implementation
```

---

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Closing Validation Without Sharing Notes

**Problem:** Team members remain unaware of outstanding work.

```md
// Bad: Notes stored locally, not committed.
```

**Solution:**

```md
Commit validation notes to `notes/validation/module-1.md` and reference them in
project brief.
```

### 2. Ignoring Minor Accessibility Warnings

**Problem:** Warnings compound when you add interactions later.

```md
// Bad: Leaving duplicate link text unresolved.
```

**Solution:**

```md
Address warnings immediately or raise a backlog item with a due date.
```

## üî® Implement in Portfolio Pulse

### Task: Log Module 1 Validation

1. Update `notes/validation/module-1.md` with automated and manual test results.
2. Record backlog items with severity, owner, and target module.
3. Sync the project brief and layout plan with any scope changes or decisions.
4. Commit with `git commit -am "docs: log module 1 validation"`.

#### Expected Result

You have a clear record of Module 1 quality checks and a prioritized list of
follow-up tasks.

_Date:_ 2024-05-15 ¬∑ _Owner:_ Avery Stone

## Automated Checks

-  HTML Validator (nu): 0 errors ¬∑ 0 warnings
-  axe DevTools: 1 warning (duplicate "Book a call" link) ‚Äî resolved by adding
   descriptive text "Book a discovery call"
-  Link Checker: Pass (all anchors resolve)

## Manual Review

-  Keyboard traversal: Pass ¬∑ Skip link visible, menu summary focusable, Escape

-  Screen reader (VoiceOver): Landmarks announced in order; aside labeled
   "Credentials & Press"
-  Print preview: Sections appear in expected sequence; aside stacks below
   highlights

## Backlog Items

| Severity | Item                                         | Owner  | Target Module |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------ | ------------- |
| High     | Replace placeholder testimonial quote        | Avery  | Module 2      |
| Medium   | Consolidate duplicate nav lists into partial | Avery  | Module 3      |
| Medium   | Style skip link + menu focus states          | Avery  | Module 2      |
| Low      | Add newsletter privacy copy                  | Jordan | Module 3      |

## Decisions & Notes

-  Footer CTA stays email-based; scheduling tool link optional for launch.
-  Accessibility doc updated with navigation requirements.
-  Layout plan references aside stacking rules for breakpoints.

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

### Functionality

-  [ ] Validation log references at least one automated and one manual test.
-  [ ] Navigation behaviors (skip link, menu toggle) documented as pass/fail.

### Code Quality

-  [ ] Backlog items include severity and owners.
-  [ ] Project brief reflects any structural updates.

### Understanding

-  [ ] You can explain all remaining issues and why they matter.
-  [ ] You know what Module 2 will address and how it depends on Module 1.

### Project Integration
