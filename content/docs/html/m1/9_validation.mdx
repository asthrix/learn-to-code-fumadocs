# Module 1 Validation

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Update `notes/validation/module-1.md` with automated and manual results.
-  [ ] Categorize findings by severity and assign clear owners.
-  [ ] Cross-reference validation outcomes in the project brief and layout plan.
-  [ ] Prioritize follow-up work for Module 2 based on the backlog.

## Project Context

Module 1 delivered a complete semantic layout. Before moving forward, confirm
that the structure holds up under validation. Pair automated tooling with manual
reviews so you can capture accessibility gaps, structural drift, or missing
content while momentum is high.

---

## Manual Checks

-  Keyboard navigation through header, sections, and footer
-  Screen reader review of landmarks (VoiceOver, NVDA)
-  Visual scan for duplicate links or inconsistent copy

## Basic Example

```md
## Module 1 Validation Notes

-  ‚úÖ axe DevTools: No violations
-  ‚ö†Ô∏è Outliner: Hero uses two h1 elements (fixed)
-  ‚úÖ Links: All anchors resolved to sections
```

## Practical Example

```md
# Module 1 ¬∑ Validation Summary

## Automated Checks

-  HTML Validator: 0 errors, 0 warnings
-  axe DevTools: 1 warning (duplicate link text "Book a call" resolved by adding
   context)

## Manual Review

-  Keyboard navigation: Pass (skip link visible, menu toggle accessible)
-  Screen reader landmark review: Pass (header, navigation, main, aside, footer
   detected)

## Backlog

-  Replace placeholder testimonial copy (owner: Avery, due Module 3)
-  Consolidate duplicate nav lists using partials (owner: Avery, due Module 4)
```

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Pair Automated and Manual Testing

**Why:** Automated tools catch structural issues, while manual reviews uncover
contextual problems.

```md
-  Automated: axe, html-validate
-  Manual: keyboard, screen reader, print preview
```

### 2. Assign Owners and Deadlines

**Why:** Documenting who will resolve issues prevents backlog stagnation.

```md
-  Issue: Placeholder testimonial
-  Owner: Avery
-  Due: Module 3
```

---

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Skipping Documentation Updates

**Problem:** Validation loses value when results stay in private notes.

```md
<!-- Bad: validation results not saved to repo -->
```

**Solution:**

```md
-  Commit notes/validation/module-1.md with findings.
-  Reference the log from docs/project-brief.md.
```

### 2. Logging Issues Without Severity

**Problem:** If backlog items lack severity, it becomes unclear what to tackle
first.

```md
-  Placeholder testimonial copy needs update.
```

**Solution:**

```md
-  Severity: High ‚Äî Replace placeholder testimonial copy (Owner: Avery,
   Module 3)
```

## üî® Implement in Portfolio Pulse

### Task: Log Module 1 Validation

1. Update `notes/validation/module-1.md` with automated and manual test results.
2. Record backlog items with severity, owner, and target module.
3. Sync the project brief and layout plan with any scope changes or decisions.
4. Commit with `git commit -am "docs: log module 1 validation"`.

#### Expected Result

You have a clear record of Module 1 quality checks and a prioritized list of
follow-up tasks.

<Accordions className="mt-6">
   <Accordion title="Solution Walkthrough">
      <p>
         Populate `notes/validation/module-1.md` with a structured log similar to
         this example.
      </p>

```md filename="notes/validation/module-1.md"
# Module 1 ¬∑ Validation Summary

_Date:_ 2024-05-15 ¬∑ _Owner:_ Avery Stone

## Automated Checks

-  HTML Validator (nu): 0 errors ¬∑ 0 warnings
-  axe DevTools: 1 warning (duplicate "Book a call" link) ‚Äî resolved by adding
   descriptive text "Book a discovery call"
-  Link Checker: Pass (all anchors resolve)

## Manual Review

-  Keyboard traversal: Pass ¬∑ Skip link visible, menu summary focusable, Escape
   closes menu
-  Screen reader (VoiceOver): Landmarks announced in order; aside labeled
   "Credentials & Press"
-  Print preview: Sections appear in expected sequence; aside stacks below
   highlights

## Backlog Items

| Severity | Item                                         | Owner  | Target Module |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------ | ------------- |
| High     | Replace placeholder testimonial quote        | Avery  | Module 2      |
| Medium   | Consolidate duplicate nav lists into partial | Avery  | Module 3      |
| Medium   | Style skip link + menu focus states          | Avery  | Module 2      |
| Low      | Add newsletter privacy copy                  | Jordan | Module 3      |

## Decisions & Notes

-  Footer CTA stays email-based; scheduling tool link optional for launch.
-  Accessibility doc updated with navigation requirements.
-  Layout plan references aside stacking rules for breakpoints.
```

      <p>
         Link this validation summary from `notes/orientation.md` so future
         collaborators can spot the latest audit at a glance.

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

### Functionality

-  [ ] Validation log references at least one automated and one manual test.
-  [ ] Navigation behaviors (skip link, menu toggle) documented as pass/fail.

### Code Quality

-  [ ] Backlog items include severity and owners.
-  [ ] Project brief reflects any structural updates.

### Understanding

-  [ ] You can explain all remaining issues and why they matter.
-  [ ] You know what Module 2 will address and how it depends on Module 1.

### Project Integration

-  [ ] Validation notes committed and linked in orientation file.
-  [ ] Layout plan references validation outcomes for the main sections.
