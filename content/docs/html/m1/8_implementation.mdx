# Module 1 Implementation

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Combine header, navigation, main sections, asides, and footer into a
       cohesive layout.
-  [ ] Confirm semantic integrity using validation tooling.
-  [ ] Record outstanding content or tooling requirements.
-  [ ] Publish a clean commit representing Module 1 state.

## Project Context

Module 1 delivers a layout that mirrors how production teams ship HTML. You now
have a collection of sections ready for styling, interaction, and richer
content. Treat this as the semantic baseline before layering CSS and JS.

## Assembly Checklist

### Review Structure

Ensure `index.html` uses one `<header>`, one `<main>`, optional `<aside>`
elements, and one `<footer>`. Confirm anchor targets exist.

### Validate Headings

Run through the document outline: `h1` ‚Üí `h2` ‚Üí `h3` without skipping levels.
Tools like the HTML5 Outliner help.

### Basic Example

```html
<header role="banner">...</header>
<main id="main-content" tabindex="-1">
   <section id="hero">...</section>
   <section id="highlights">...</section>
   <aside aria-label="Credentials">...</aside>
   <section id="services">...</section>
   <section id="testimonials">...</section>
   <section id="contact">...</section>
</main>
<footer role="contentinfo">...</footer>
```

### Practical Example

```
// Combine all snippets from lessons 3-7 into index.html.
```

Rather than rewriting, ensure you pasted or assembled each section exactly once
and removed placeholder comments.

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Run Automated Outline Checks

**Why:** Tools like the Firefox Accessibility Inspector reveal heading orders
and landmark usage instantly.

```bash
# Using html-validate with heading rule
npx html-validate --config .htmlvalidate.json index.html
```

### 2. Snapshot the DOM

**Why:** Saving a DOM snapshot (via browser devtools) provides a reference for
future modules and ensures nothing accidentally changes.

```md
notes/dom-snapshots/module-1.md
```

---

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Leaving TODO Comments Untracked

**Problem:** Comments with `TODO` but no tracking leads to forgotten work.

```html
<!-- TODO: add new testimonial -->
```

**Solution:**

```md
notes/retro-log.md ‚Üí Add backlog item referencing the section.
```

### 2. Forgetting to Update Accessibility Docs

**Problem:** Structural changes without documentation break alignment.

```md
// Bad: accessibility manifesto still mentions old nav structure.
```

**Solution:**

```md
Update docs/accessibility.md with the latest structural context.
```

## üî® Implement in Portfolio Pulse

### Task: Finalize Module 1 Layout

1. Ensure `index.html` includes the header, navigation, hero, highlights,
   services, testimonials, aside, contact, and footer from previous lessons.
2. Run `npx html-validate index.html` or the W3C validator to confirm zero
   errors.
3. Capture a DOM snapshot (or copy outline results) in
   `notes/validation/module-1.md`.
4. Commit with `git commit -am "feat: deliver module 1 semantic layout"`.

#### Expected Result

Portfolio Pulse now presents a complete semantic layout that is ready for Module
2's form enhancements.

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

### Functionality

-  [ ] Navigation anchors scroll to valid section IDs.
-  [ ] Mobile menu toggles and skip link still work after assembly.

### Code Quality

-  [ ] Document outline shows proper heading sequence.
-  [ ] Asides contain supplemental content only.

### Understanding

-  [ ] You can explain how each section maps to user needs.
-  [ ] You know which sections require CSS or JS in future modules.

### Project Integration

-  [ ] Validation notes saved to `notes/validation/module-1.md`.
-  [ ] Documentation (layout plan, accessibility manifesto) reflect current
       state.
