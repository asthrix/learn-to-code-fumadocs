# Module 1 · Semantic Layout & Landmarks

Module 1 upgrades the baseline document into a portfolio that feels curated and
navigable. You will refine header composition, landmark usage, and sectional
rhythms so designers, screen readers, and search engines all perceive the same
story.

### What You Will Deliver

-  A header with branding, navigation, and skip links that meet accessibility
   standards.
-  A hero, highlights, services, testimonials, and contact sections using
   semantic HTML5 landmarks.
-  Supporting asides that enrich the narrative without overwhelming the main
   flow.

### Lesson Map

1. **Semantic Layout Overview** — clarify module goals and review landmark
   patterns.
2. **Landmark Planning** — map each section to structural primitives (`header`,
   `nav`, `main`, `aside`, `footer`).
3. **Header Strategy** — design a versatile site header with logo, nav, and
   call-to-action.
4. **Navigation Accessibility** — refine keyboard support, skip links, and ARIA
   labelling.
5. **Main Content Architecture** — craft hero, highlights, services, and
   testimonials with sectioning elements.
6. **Supporting Asides** — use `<aside>` for credentials, stats, and quick
   facts.
7. **Footer Calls to Action** — close with contact options, secondary
   navigation, and legal info.
8. **Implementation** — assemble the full semantic layout.
9. **Validation** — audit structure, headings, and interactive elements.

Keep your project brief and validation logs nearby; you will reference them
frequently to ensure markup mirrors the story you promised in Module 0.
