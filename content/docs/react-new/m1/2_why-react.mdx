# Why React?

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] List the benefits React brings to modern web applications.
-  [ ] Compare React with Vanilla JS and full frameworks like Angular.
-  [ ] Map ecosystem tools to upcoming TaskFlow Pro modules.
-  [ ] Share real-world examples of React at scale.

## Project Context

Choosing React is a strategic decision. You will leverage its flexibility,
community, and tooling across every feature of TaskFlow Pro.

---

## Business Case

-  **Developer Velocity:** Component reuse speeds up feature delivery.
-  **Talent Pool:** React is widely taught, easing hiring.
-  **Community Support:** Thousands of libraries accelerate development.

### Basic Example

```md
React powers Facebook, Netflix, Shopify, Airbnb, and countless SaaS startups.
```

### Practical Example

```tsx
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "@tanstack/react-query";

const queryClient = new QueryClient();

export function AppProviders({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
   return (
      <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>{children}</QueryClientProvider>
   );
}
```

React's ecosystem integrates seamlessly, letting you drop in tools like React
Query in Module 3.

## React vs Alternatives

| Feature        | React                            | Angular                        | Vue                         |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Philosophy     | Library (bring your own tooling) | Framework (batteries included) | Progressive framework       |
| Learning Curve | Gentle start, depth later        | Steeper upfront                | Between React and Angular   |
| Ecosystem      | Huge third-party library set     | Official CLI, opinionated      | Balanced third-party + core |

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Adopt Tools Gradually

**Why:** React's flexibility lets you add libraries only when needed.

```md
Module timeline:

-  M1: React + Tailwind
-  M3: Axios + React Query (optional)
-  M7: React Hook Form
```

### 2. Benchmark Needs Against Ecosystem

**Why:** Avoid reinventing the wheel; rely on proven libraries when they reduce
risk.

---

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Installing Everything Day One

**Problem:** Bloated dependencies complicate onboarding.

**Solution:** Add packages when a module requires them and document why.

### 2. Ignoring Browser Support

**Problem:** New APIs may not work without polyfills.

**Solution:** Use tools like `@vitejs/plugin-legacy` when supporting older
browsers.

## üî® Implement in TaskFlow Pro

### Task: Ecosystem Roadmap

1. Update `docs/dependencies.md` with a section titled "When We Introduce It".
2. For each dependency (React Router, React Hook Form, etc.), note the module
   where it appears.
3. Add a short reason (e.g., "Routing" or "Forms").
4. Commit with `git commit -am "docs: map dependencies to modules"`.

<Accordions type='single' className='mt-4'>
   <Accordion title='Solution Walkthrough'>
      <p>
         Extend <code>docs/dependencies.md</code> with a module-aware table so every
         dependency ties back to a TaskFlow Pro milestone. The matrix below keeps the
         roadmap aligned with the final project scope.
      </p>

      ```md
      ## When We Introduce It

      | Package | Introduced In | Why It Matters |
      | --- | --- | --- |
      | react-router-dom | Module 4 ¬∑ Routing | Power dashboard ‚Üî task board navigation and deep links. |
      | @tanstack/react-query | Module MX ¬∑ Extended Capabilities | Handle task fetching, caching, and optimistic updates. |
      | react-hook-form | Module 7 ¬∑ Forms & Auth | Manage task create/edit flows with validation. |
      | zustand | Module 6 ¬∑ State Management | Provide lightweight global state for preferences. |
      | tailwindcss-animate | Module 5 ¬∑ Hooks & Performance | Add micro-interactions to the command palette. |
      ```

      <p className='mt-3'>Document additional libraries as the backlog evolves, then commit:</p>

      ```bash
      git add docs/dependencies.md
      git commit -m "docs: map dependencies to modules"
      ```
   </Accordion>
</Accordions>

#### Expected Result

Future contributors can see which module introduces each library and why.
