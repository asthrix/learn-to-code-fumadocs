# Introduction to Hooks

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Describe why hooks replaced class lifecycle methods for most use cases.
-  [ ] Use `useState` to maintain local component state.
-  [ ] Understand how `useEffect` connects to side effects.
-  [ ] Follow the Rules of Hooks to keep logic predictable.

## Project Context

Hooks underpin TaskFlow Pro's interactivity. You will use them extensively from
Module 2 onward for state, effects, memoisation, and more.

---

## Why Hooks?

Hooks let you reuse stateful logic without classes or higher-order components.
They simplify component hierarchies and improve code reuse.

### Basic Example

```tsx
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

### Practical Example

```tsx
export function QuickAddTask() {
   const [title, setTitle] = useState("");
   const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);

   useEffect(() => {
      if (!isOpen) {
         setTitle("");
      }
   }, [isOpen]);

   return (
      <form className='space-y-3'>
         <input
            value={title}
            onChange={(event) => setTitle(event.target.value)}
            className='w-full rounded border px-3 py-2'
            placeholder='Add a task'
         />
         <button
            type='submit'
            className='rounded bg-primary px-3 py-2 text-white'
         >
            Save task
         </button>
      </form>
   );
}
```

## Rules of Hooks

1. **Only call hooks at the top level.** No loops, conditions, or nested
   functions.
2. **Only call hooks from React components or custom hooks.**

Following these rules ensures React preserves hook order between renders.

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Initialise State with Functions When Expensive

**Why:** Lazily compute defaults only once.

```tsx
const [initialTasks] = useState(() => loadSeedTasks());
```

### 2. Group Related State

**Why:** Avoid multiple hooks for tightly coupled values.

```tsx
const [formState, setFormState] = useState({ title: "", notes: "" });
```

---

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Calling Hooks Conditionally

**Problem:** Breaks hook ordering.

```tsx
if (isVisible) {
   const [count] = useState(0);
}
```

**Solution:** Call hooks unconditionally and use conditional logic inside.

### 2. Forgetting Dependency Arrays

**Problem:** Effects run too often or too rarely.

**Solution:** Always provide dependencies and rely on ESLint plugin for hooks.

## üî® Implement in TaskFlow Pro

### Task: Create a Hook Scratch Pad

1. Add `src/sandbox/hooks-playground.tsx`.
2. Build a small component using `useState` for form inputs and `useEffect` to
   log when values change.
3. Mount it under the sandbox section created earlier.
4. Note future hook ideas (e.g., `useTaskFilters`) in
   `notes/react-foundations.md`.
5. Commit with `git commit -am "chore: add hooks playground"`.

#### Expected Result

You gain hands-on familiarity with hooks before diving deeper in Module 2.

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

### Functionality

-  [ ] Hooks playground updates state and logs effect changes.

### Code Quality

-  [ ] Hooks follow the Rules of Hooks.
-  [ ] ESLint `react-hooks` plugin runs without warnings.

### Understanding

-  [ ] You can explain why hooks replaced most class components.

### Project Integration

-  [ ] Notes list ideas for custom hooks aligned with TaskFlow Pro features.
