# Component Lifecycle

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Explain the mount ‚Üí update ‚Üí unmount lifecycle.
-  [ ] Understand when `useEffect` runs in React 18 strict mode.
-  [ ] Plan cleanup logic for timers, subscriptions, or listeners.
-  [ ] Anticipate concurrent rendering nuances.

## Project Context

TaskFlow Pro will use effects for analytics, shortcuts, and persisted state.
Knowing the lifecycle prevents memory leaks and duplicated work.

---

## Lifecycle Phases

1. **Mount:** Component renders for the first time.
2. **Update:** Props or state change triggers re-render.
3. **Unmount:** Component removed from the tree.

### Basic Example

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
   console.log("mounted");
   return () => console.log("unmounted");
}, []);
```

### Practical Example

```tsx
export function KeyboardShortcuts() {
   useEffect(() => {
      const handleKey = (event: KeyboardEvent) => {
         if (event.key === "n" && event.metaKey) {
            event.preventDefault();
            // open quick add modal
         }
      };

      window.addEventListener("keydown", handleKey);
      return () => window.removeEventListener("keydown", handleKey);
   }, []);

   return null;
}
```

## React 18 Strict Mode

Strict mode intentionally double-invokes certain lifecycle methods (including
effects) in development to surface unsafe side effects. Always make effects
idempotent.

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Keep Effects Focused

**Why:** Narrow scope simplifies debugging.

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
   document.title = `${completed}/${total} tasks complete`;
}, [completed, total]);
```

### 2. Clean Up on Unmount

**Why:** Prevents event listeners or timers from persisting.

```tsx
return () => clearInterval(intervalId);
```

---

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Skipping Dependency Arrays

**Problem:** Effect runs on every render, causing loops.

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
   setState(data);
});
```

**Solution:** Provide dependency list or refactor logic.

### 2. Mutating State During Render

**Problem:** Causes inconsistent UI and warnings.

**Solution:** Use effects or event handlers for side effects.

## üî® Implement in TaskFlow Pro

### Task: Lifecycle Notes Component

1. Create `src/components/system/LifecycleLogger.tsx`.
2. Use `useEffect` to log mount and unmount events (development only).
3. Render the component beneath the dashboard header temporarily.
4. Document scenarios where this tool helps (e.g., verifying cleanup) in
   `notes/react-foundations.md`.
5. Commit with `git commit -am "chore: add lifecycle logger"`.

#### Expected Result

Console logs confirm when components mount/unmount, making debugging easier
during future modules.

---

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

### Functionality

-  [ ] Logger prints mount/unmount messages when toggling views.

### Code Quality

-  [ ] Effects include cleanup and dependency arrays.
-  [ ] Logger only runs in development (`if (import.meta.env.DEV)`).

### Understanding

-  [ ] You can describe why effects run twice in development.

### Project Integration

-  [ ] Notes mention removing or guarding the logger for production builds.
