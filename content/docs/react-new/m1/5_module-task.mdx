# Module Task · Landing Page Milestone

Time to lock in the work you just completed. This milestone ensures your landing
page is production-ready before we add interactivity in Module 2.

---

## Milestone Requirements

1. **Responsive layout**: Header, hero, and listing grid adapt to mobile,
   tablet, and desktop breakpoints.
2. **Accessible markup**: Headings follow a logical hierarchy; buttons and
   anchors have descriptive text.
3. **Sample listings**: Render at least six listings with images, prices, and
   amenities.
4. **Global styles**: Background, typography, and colours are cohesive.
5. **Snapshot**: Capture a screenshot to include in release notes.

---

## Task · Prepare the Landing Page Release

1. Expand `featuredListings` to six items (add three more objects with unique
   IDs and imagery).
2. Add an "About StaySense" section beneath the listing grid explaining the
   mission in two paragraphs.
3. Create `docs/releases/m1-landing-page.md` summarising work shipped, known
   limitations, and the screenshot path.
4. Commit with `git commit -am "feat: finalise staysense landing milestone"`.

      ```tsx
      // src/components/AboutSection.tsx
      export function AboutSection() {
         return (
            <section id='about' className='bg-slate-950 py-16'>
               <div className='mx-auto flex w-full max-w-4xl flex-col gap-6 px-6 text-slate-200'>
                  <h2 className='text-2xl font-semibold text-white'>Why StaySense?</h2>
                  <p>
                     StaySense surfaces design-forward rentals that prioritise atmosphere and wellbeing. Our curators score each stay on ambience, service, and environmental impact so you can pick destinations with confidence.

                  <p>
                     Behind the scenes we lean on a mock API today, but the architecture mirrors a production-ready service described in the Project React documentation. You are building foundations that scale.

      # Module 1 · Landing Page Milestone

      ## Highlights
      - Built responsive header, hero, and featured listings grid.
      - Added amenity badges and CTA buttons to drive deeper exploration.
      - Documented environment and component structure for future contributors.

      ## Screenshot
      - `docs/releases/screenshots/m1-landing.png`

      ## Known Limitations
      - Listings are static JSON; filters not yet implemented.
      - CTA buttons scroll to anchors only—detail pages arrive in Module 4.
      ```

      ```bash
      git add src/data/listings.ts src/components/AboutSection.tsx src/App.tsx docs/releases/m1-landing-page.md
      git commit -m "feat: finalise staysense landing milestone"
      ```
