# Introduction to State Management

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Spot features that suffer from prop drilling or duplicated state.
-  [ ] Classify state by ownership (local vs shared vs server).
-  [ ] Outline a migration plan for TaskFlow Pro.
-  [ ] Understand how Redux complements Context.

## Project Context

TaskFlow Pro now has performance guardrails. Next, you must centralise global
state (projects, tasks, user preferences) to keep features consistent across
modules. Module 6 lays the foundation.

## Why Shared State Matters

-  Multiple routes edit the same project data; local state causes drift.
-  Performance optimisations rely on memoised selectors.
-  Collaboration features (notifications, assignments) need a single source of
   truth.

### State Categories

| Type   | Examples                       | Ownership        |
| ------ | ------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| Local  | Modal open state, form inputs  | Component        |
| Shared | Active project, sidebar filter | Module/Feature   |
| Server | Task records, audit logs       | Backend services |

## Drafting the Rollout

1. Audit existing state usage (components, hooks, route loaders).
2. Decide which domains use Context vs Redux.
3. List data contracts between UI and async APIs.

<Accordions type='single' className='mt-4'>
   <Accordion title='State Rollout Template'>
      <p>Use this template to plan the global state migration.</p>

      ```md filename="notes/module-6-state-plan.md"
      ## State Audit
      - Shared: activeProjectId (dashboard, project detail)
      - Preferences: theme, density
      - Async: projects, tasks, activity feed

      ## Rollout
      - Context: preferences, feature toggles
      - Redux: projects/tasks data, async queues
      - Milestones: Week 1 audit, Week 2 Context, Week 3 Redux store
      ```

   </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## ✅ Validation Checklist

-  [ ] Stakeholders agree on the state ownership plan.
-  [ ] Critical flows relying on local state are documented.
-  [ ] Success metrics captured (fewer prop chains, reduced re-renders).
