# Redux Part 1

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Configure Redux Toolkit with TypeScript support.
-  [ ] Create slices for projects and tasks with initial state.
-  [ ] Register the store in the React tree.
-  [ ] Expose typed hooks for dispatching actions and reading state.

## Setting Up the Store

```tsx
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import { projectsReducer } from "./projectsSlice";
import { tasksReducer } from "./tasksSlice";

export const store = configureStore({
   reducer: {
      projects: projectsReducer,
      tasks: tasksReducer,
   },
});

export type RootState = ReturnType<typeof store.getState>;
export type AppDispatch = typeof store.dispatch;
```

---

## Typed Hooks

```tsx
import { TypedUseSelectorHook, useDispatch, useSelector } from "react-redux";

export const useAppDispatch = () => useDispatch<AppDispatch>();
export const useAppSelector: TypedUseSelectorHook<RootState> = useSelector;
```

-  Ensures components access strongly typed state slices.
-  Encourages selectors for derived data (introduced in Part 2).

---

## Wiring the Provider

```tsx
import { Provider as ReduxProvider } from "react-redux";
import { store } from "@/state/store";

export function AppProviders({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
   return <ReduxProvider store={store}>{children}</ReduxProvider>;
}
```

Combine with `PreferencesProvider` and Zustand stores from earlier lessons to
form a complete provider stack.

      <p>Bring Redux Toolkit into TaskFlow Pro.</p>

      ```bash
      npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
      ```

      ```tsx filename="src/state/store.ts"
      import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
      import { projectsReducer } from "@/state/projectsSlice";
      import { tasksReducer } from "@/state/tasksSlice";

      export const store = configureStore({
         reducer: {
            projects: projectsReducer,
            tasks: tasksReducer,
         },
         devTools: process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production",
      });
      ```

   </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## ✅ Validation Checklist

-  [ ] Store composes all planned slices.
-  [ ] Provider wraps the app without breaking existing routes.
-  [ ] Typed hooks available across modules.
