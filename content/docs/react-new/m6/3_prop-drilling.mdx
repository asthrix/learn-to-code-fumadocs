# Prop Drilling

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Audit components for long prop chains.
-  [ ] Understand why prop drilling hurts maintainability.
-  [ ] Choose between hooks, context, or Redux to replace drilling.
-  [ ] Create a de-risked refactor plan.

## Spotting Prop Drilling

-  Props forwarded through 5+ component levels.
-  Components receiving props they do not use directly.
-  Frequent render cascades triggered by unrelated updates.

### Example Anti-Pattern

```tsx
<ProjectDashboard
   user={user}
   projects={projects}
   activeProjectId={activeProjectId}
   onSelectProject={setActiveProjectId}
/>
```

Every child now depends on `activeProjectId`, even when it only needs a subset.

## Refactoring Approach

1. Identify props that represent global or shared state.
2. Decide on Context vs Redux ownership.
3. Replace prop chain with provider + selector or hook.
4. Verify component tests and stories.

      ## Prop Drilling Remediation
      - [ ] Dashboard sidebar uses `usePreferencesContext`
      - [ ] Task table consumes Redux selectors for active project
      - [ ] Analytics panel receives data from shared selectors
      ```

   </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## ✅ Validation Checklist

-  [ ] No component forwards props it does not use.
-  [ ] Render profiling confirms fewer unnecessary commits.
-  [ ] Team documentation updated with refactor outcomes.
