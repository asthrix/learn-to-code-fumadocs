# State Management in React

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Differentiate local, derived, and remote state in React.
-  [ ] Decide when to escalate from `useState` to `useReducer`.
-  [ ] Evaluate Context vs Redux for TaskFlow Pro domains.
-  [ ] Document decision criteria for future features.

## Recap of React State Tools

-  `useState` → simple primitives, local scope.
-  `useReducer` → predictable updates with action types.
-  `useMemo`/`useCallback` → derived state without re-compute.

### When `useState` Falls Short

-  Prop drilling across 4+ components.
-  Multiple components mutating the same data.
-  Need for devtools, time-travel, or middleware.

## Decision Matrix

| Scenario                      | Recommended Tool           |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| UI toggles (modal open, tabs) | `useState`                 |
| Complex local logic           | `useReducer`               |
| Cross-route preferences       | Context + reducer          |
| Server-synced entities        | Redux Toolkit slices       |
| Caching + async workflows     | Redux Toolkit + thunks/RTK |

## TaskFlow Pro Guidelines

1. Keep project/task entities in Redux slices.
2. Use Context for user preferences and feature flags.
3. Derive UI state (filters, sorts) from selectors or hooks.
4. Document decisions to streamline code reviews.

      ## Decision Record · Task Filters
      - Reasoning: filters cross multiple routes and require URL sync
      - Solution: Redux slice with selectors + persistence middleware
      - Alternatives: Context (rejected due to analytics requirements)
      ```

## ✅ Validation Checklist

-  [ ] Each state domain mapped to a preferred tool.
-  [ ] Team agrees on escalation criteria.
-  [ ] Documentation updated with new decision records.
