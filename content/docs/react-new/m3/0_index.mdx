# Module 3 · Data & Effects

Time to swap static data for the mock backend described in
`/course-docs/API_AND_DATA_ARCHITECTURE.md`. You'll fetch listings via Axios,
handle loading and error states, and expose data through context so multiple
components can consume it cleanly.

---

## What You Will Build

-  An Axios client configured with the provided mock adapter.
-  A `useListings` hook that hides implementation details from components.
-  Loading, empty, and error UI states that feel polished.
-  Context to share listings across the app without prop drilling.

---

## Lesson Roadmap

1. **Lesson 1 – Effect basics**: understand `useEffect`, dependency arrays, and
   cleanup functions.
2. **Lesson 2 – Mock API fetching**: wire Axios, adapters, and listing requests.
3. **Lesson 3 – Loading & errors**: show skeletons, handle 4xx/5xx, and recover.
4. **Lesson 4 – Shared context**: expose listings via React context for reuse.
5. **Lesson 5 – Module task**: ship API-backed listings with resilient UX.

---

## Success Criteria

-  Listings load from `/api/listings`, respecting current filters.
-  UI represents loading, empty, and failure states clearly.
-  Context provider encapsulates fetching logic and caches results.
-  Release notes explain the mock backend flow and future improvements.

      <p>
         The mock API uses an auth wrapper, but public listing endpoints are
         open. You’ll integrate authentication tokens in the flagship course’s
         Module 7.
