# Performance in React

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Describe how React's render and commit phases influence performance.
-  [ ] Recognise patterns that trigger unnecessary re-renders in TaskFlow Pro.
-  [ ] Use React's batching and transition APIs to smooth updates.
-  [ ] Incorporate profiling data into the Module 5 plan.

## Project Context

TaskFlow Pro manipulates task lists, filters, and analytics in near real time.
Understanding React's lifecycle lets you reason about when components render and
how to reduce the work required.

---

## React Rendering Basics

1. **Render phase:** React calls components to produce the next UI tree.
2. **Commit phase:** React applies DOM mutations and runs layout effects.
3. **Paint & idle:** Browser paints and handles background work.

React re-renders when props or state change. Memoisation helps prevent
unnecessary renders when inputs remain unchanged.

---

## Batching Updates

React automatically batches state updates inside event handlers.

### Basic Example

```tsx
setFilter(nextFilter);
setSearch(nextSearch);
// React batches both calls into a single render
```

### Practical Example

```tsx
startTransition(() => {
   setSearch(query);
   setStatusFilter("all");
});
```

`startTransition` marks updates as non-urgent so UI stays responsive.

---

## Profiling with React DevTools

1. Record a session while typing in the search field.
2. Inspect flame charts for `TaskList` and `DashboardStats`.
3. Note components that re-render despite unchanged data.

Use these observations to prioritise memoisation targets.

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Keep Component Boundaries Clean

**Why:** Smaller components make it obvious when props change.

### 2. Measure with Production Builds

**Why:** Development builds add extra checks; production profiling shows
realistic performance.

```bash
npm run build && npm run start
```

---

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Overusing Memoisation

**Problem:** Memoising everything adds complexity and memory overhead.

**Solution:** Optimise only when profiling shows a benefit.

### 2. Ignoring Suspense and Transitions

**Problem:** Without transitions, typing in search fields can feel laggy.

**Solution:** Use `startTransition` for large list filtering or asynchronous
updates.

---

## üî® Implement in TaskFlow Pro

Connect theory to practice:

1. Profile the dashboard while filtering tasks; capture a screenshot or note
   flame chart hotspots.
2. Update `notes/module-5-performance-plan.md` with a "Profiling" section
   summarising findings and linking to assets.
3. Identify which updates should use `startTransition` (e.g., search filter).
4. Commit with `git commit -am "docs: profile module 5 baseline"`.

      ```md filename="notes/module-5-performance-plan.md"
      ## Profiling Notes
      - Search input triggers 6 renders in `TaskList` for a single keystroke
      - `DashboardStats` recomputes derived counts on every toggle
      - Candidate transitions: search query updates, status filter changes
      ```

      ```bash
      git add notes/module-5-performance-plan.md
      git commit -m "docs: profile module 5 baseline"
      ```

   </Accordion>
</Accordions>

#### Expected Result

You understand React's rendering model, documented profiling insights, and
prepared to apply memoisation in subsequent lessons.

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

### Functionality

-  [ ] Profiling section includes at least three observations.
-  [ ] Transition candidates tie back to real UI interactions.

### Code Quality

-  [ ] Notes cite the profiling tool and context.
-  [ ] Documentation stays alongside the Module 5 plan.

### Understanding

-  [ ] You can explain render vs commit phases.
-  [ ] You know when batching happens automatically.

### Project Integration

-  [ ] Insights reference specific TaskFlow Pro components.
-  [ ] Transition ideas feed into upcoming memoisation lessons.
