# Project Overview

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Outline the user-facing features of TaskFlow Pro.
-  [ ] Understand the architecture layers you will build.
-  [ ] Recognise how the UI kit and API connect.
-  [ ] Define what "done" means for the final project.

## Project Context

Before writing a line of code we need a mental model for the finished app. This
lesson clarifies what we are building and why each module matters.

## Product Summary

TaskFlow Pro helps teams capture, organise, and deliver work. Users can create
projects, add tasks with due dates and priorities, and monitor progress through
dashboards.

### Feature Milestones

-  **M1:** Chrome for the app‚Äîglobal header, sidebar, and task cards.
-  **M2:** Full CRUD for tasks with inline editing.
-  **M3:** Remote persistence via REST API + optimistic updates.
-  **M4:** Dedicated routes for Dashboard, Projects, Settings.
-  **M5‚ÄìM7:** Performance, global state, forms, and authentication.
-  **M8:** Production-grade deployment to Vercel.

### Basic Example

```ts
export const taskflowModules = [
   { id: "m1", theme: "fundamentals", outcome: "UI shell ready" },
   { id: "m2", theme: "state", outcome: "CRUD interactions live" },
];
```

### Practical Example

```ts
export type Task = {
   id: string;
   title: string;
   description: string;
   dueDate: string;
   priority: "low" | "medium" | "high";
   status: "todo" | "in-progress" | "done";
};

export type Project = {
   id: string;
   name: string;
   summary: string;
   tasks: Task[];
};
```

These types guide the UI shape you will implement in upcoming modules.

---

## Architecture at a Glance

-  **Client:** Vite + React + TypeScript.
-  **Styles:** Tailwind CSS with a small design token layer.
-  **State:** Hooks and Context; later modules introduce Redux patterns.
-  **Data:** REST API served locally via mock server ‚Üí replaced with hosted
   endpoint in MX.

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Establish Domain Language Early

**Why:** Consistent naming keeps code readable across files and contributors.

```md
Glossary snippet:

-  Task: atomic piece of work
-  Project: collection of tasks
-  View: route-level screen
```

### 2. Document Success Criteria

**Why:** Prevents scope creep and keeps modules focused.

```md
Success = responsive UI, persistent tasks, accessible forms, deployed build.
```

---

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Skipping Architecture Notes

**Problem:** Without a blueprint decisions become inconsistent.

```md
// Bad: "Figure it out later" in planning doc.
```

**Solution:**

```md
Add diagrams or bullet points before coding.
```

### 2. Overloading Module 0

**Problem:** Trying to build features before foundations leads to rewrites.

```md
// Bad: starting authentication before base layout exists.
```

**Solution:**

```md
Follow the roadmap; finish one milestone before the next.
```

## üî® Implement in TaskFlow Pro

### Task: Create a Project Blueprint

1. Add `docs/project-overview.md`.
2. Include sections for features, personas, and success metrics.
3. Paste the TypeScript interfaces above into the doc for quick reference.
4. Commit with `git commit -am "docs: add project overview"`.

#### Expected Result

You and future collaborators can instantly grasp what TaskFlow Pro should
deliver.

---

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

### Functionality

-  [ ] `docs/project-overview.md` exists with feature bullets.
-  [ ] Interfaces for `Task` and `Project` are recorded.

### Code Quality

-  [ ] Commit groups documentation changes only.
-  [ ] Filenames use kebab-case or lower-case where appropriate.

### Understanding

-  [ ] You can explain the app in under 30 seconds.
-  [ ] You know which module handles routing vs. data fetching.

### Project Integration

-  [ ] Notes file links to the overview doc.
-  [ ] Backlog of future stretch goals (optional) recorded separately.
