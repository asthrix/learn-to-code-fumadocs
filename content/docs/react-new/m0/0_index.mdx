# Module 0 · Kickstart

Module 0 clears the runway. Across twelve compact lessons you will install
tooling, explore the TaskFlow Pro architecture, and ship the initial scaffold
that powers every later module.

### What You Will Ship

-  Local development workspace with Node.js, npm, VS Code, and Git ready.
-  A fresh Vite + React project configured with ESLint, Prettier, Tailwind CSS,
   and opinionated folder structure.
-  Shared environment variables and scripts that your future self can reuse
   without guesswork.

### Lesson Map

1. **Welcome** — orient yourself and preview the final app.
2. **Downloads & Setup** — install core tooling.
3. **Project Overview** — peek at features and data flows.
4. **Dependencies** — document the libraries we rely on.
5. **Linting & Formatting** — lock in consistent code.
6. **API Overview** — understand the mock backend.
7. **UI Components** — review the design system you'll build.
8. **Environment Variables** — separate secrets from code.
9. **Running the Project** — start dev servers with confidence.
10.   **Working with the Project** — practice the day-to-day workflow.
11.   **Implementation** — bootstrap TaskFlow Pro.
12.   **Validation** — confirm everything works before M1.

Keep a notebook or digital doc for lessons learned; you'll reuse the same
checklist format in later modules.
