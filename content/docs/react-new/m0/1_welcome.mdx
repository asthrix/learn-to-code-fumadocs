# Welcome to Project React

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Tell the TaskFlow Pro story in one sentence.
-  [ ] Understand how each module ladders up to a deployed app.
-  [ ] Recognise why we pair explanations with hands-on steps.
-  [ ] Know where to ask for help when you get stuck.

## Project Context

TaskFlow Pro is a modern task management app inspired by tools like Asana and
Linear. It is the red thread for the entire course; every snippet, refactor, and
checklist keeps the project moving toward a production deployment.

---

## Why Project-Based?

### Learning That Sticks

We learn faster when new ideas are attached to something tangible. Instead of
memorising React APIs, you apply them immediately to features that ship inside
TaskFlow Pro.

### Skill Growth Over Trivia

Recruiters care about shipped projects. Completing this course leaves you with
an application you understand deeply, alongside habits that mirror real-world
teams.

### Basic Example

```tsx
function WelcomeMessage() {
   return <p>Welcome to TaskFlow Pro ‚Äî your productivity coach!</p>;
}
```

### Practical Example

```tsx
import type { ReactNode } from "react";

type LessonTeaserProps = {
   icon: ReactNode;
   title: string;
   blurb: string;
};

export function LessonTeaser({ icon, title, blurb }: LessonTeaserProps) {
   return (
      <article className='flex items-start gap-3 rounded-lg border bg-card p-4'>
         <span className='text-xl' aria-hidden>
            {icon}
         </span>
         <div>
            <h3 className='text-base font-semibold'>{title}</h3>
            <p className='text-sm text-muted-foreground'>{blurb}</p>
         </div>
      </article>
   );
}
```

Use components like `LessonTeaser` across modules to remind learners what they
are about to build.

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Anchor Concepts to Outcomes

**Why:** Learners retain information when it solves a visible problem.

```tsx
// Good: tie hooks to a final experience
const upcomingModules = ["State & events", "Effects & data"];
```

### 2. Set a Support System Early

**Why:** Beginners progress faster when they know where to look for answers.

```md
-  React docs ‚Üí https://react.dev
-  MDN JavaScript ‚Üí https://developer.mozilla.org
-  Course Q&A ‚Üí internal forum or Slack
```

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Treating Lessons as Standalone

**Problem:** Forgetting the project arc leads to disjointed learning.

```md
// Bad: jumping around modules without finishing validation steps.
```

**Solution:**

```md
1. Finish a lesson.
2. Run the checklist.
3. Commit changes tagged with the lesson ID.
```

### 2. Skipping Retrospectives

**Problem:** Learners who do not reflect stall when revisiting topics.

```md
// Bad: no notes on what worked, what was confusing, or next questions.
```

**Solution:**

```md
-  Jot one win, one question, one idea after each lesson.
```

## üî® Implement in TaskFlow Pro

### Task: Create a Course Notes Document

1. Create a `notes/` folder at the root of your project.
2. Add `m0-notes.md` with space for wins, blockers, and TODOs per lesson.
3. Commit the file with `git commit -m "docs: add m0 notes template"`.

#### Expected Result

You now have a dedicated place to capture insights and questions, ready for
review during validation.

---

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

### Functionality

-  [ ] Notes file exists inside `notes/m0-notes.md`.
-  [ ] Git commit recorded the new documentation.

### Code Quality

-  [ ] Commit message follows `<type>: <description>` style.
-  [ ] Repository runs `npm run lint` without errors.

### Understanding

-  [ ] You can summarise the project scope to a peer.
-  [ ] You know where to find official React resources.

### Project Integration

-  [ ] Notes document includes the module lesson list.
-  [ ] Next actions for Module 0 are captured.
