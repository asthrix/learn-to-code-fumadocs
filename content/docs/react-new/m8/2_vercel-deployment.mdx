## Preview Deployments

-  Every PR should generate a preview URL.
-  Share preview links with QA and product for sign-off.
-  Enable password protection if sharing outside the org.

```bash
# Trigger redeploy for a given commit
vercel --prebuilt --env-file=.env.preview
```

---

## Production Promotion

```bash
# Promote the latest preview to production
vercel promote
```

-  Verify logs in the Vercel dashboard.
-  Confirm environment variable overrides for production.

---

## Notifications & Observability

-  Connect Slack or Teams notifications for deployment success/failure.
-  Enable Vercel Analytics for traffic insights.
-  Forward logs to the centralized observability stack if available.
