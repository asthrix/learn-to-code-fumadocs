# Forms in React

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Understand trade-offs between controlled and uncontrolled inputs.
-  [ ] Know how browser form events interact with React state.
-  [ ] Apply accessibility patterns (labels, descriptions, errors).
-  [ ] Choose when to introduce form libraries.

## Controlled vs Uncontrolled

| Pattern      | Pros                              | Cons                              | Use When                    |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Controlled   | Single source of truth, easy sync | More renders, boilerplate         | Complex validation, dynamic |
| Uncontrolled | Minimal renders, native behaviour | Harder to sync state, manual refs | Simple forms, low logic     |

## Accessibility Essentials

-  Associate `<label>` with `htmlFor` attributes.
-  Provide helper text using `aria-describedby`.
-  Set `aria-invalid` and `role="alert"` for error messages.
-  Ensure keyboard focus order matches visual layout.

```tsx
<label htmlFor='email'>Email</label>
<input
   id='email'
   name='email'
   type='email'
   aria-describedby='email-help email-error'
   aria-invalid={Boolean(errors.email)}
/>
<p id='email-help' className='text-sm text-muted-foreground'>Use your work email.</p>
```

## When to Adopt a Form Library

-  Repeated validation logic across forms.
-  Need for async validation and field arrays.
-  Want built-in integration with schema validators (Zod, Yup).
-  Desire for granular input registration (React Hook Form).

<Accordions type='single' className='mt-4'>
   <Accordion title='TaskFlow Pro Decisions'>
      <p>Document chosen patterns before implementation.</p>

      ```md filename="notes/module-7-forms-auth-plan.md"
      ## Form Architecture Decisions
      - Controlled: sign-up (needs dynamic company fields)
      - Uncontrolled + RHF: login, reset (fast interactions)
      - Accessibility: label, hint, error IDs standardised
      - Library: React Hook Form + Zod for schema validation
      ```

   </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## ✅ Validation Checklist

-  [ ] Each form flow mapped to controlled/uncontrolled strategy.
-  [ ] Accessibility requirements documented.
-  [ ] React Hook Form adoption justified with team.
