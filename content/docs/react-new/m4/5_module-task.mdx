# Capstone Task · StaySense MVP

This is it—package StaySense for reviewers, hiring managers, or future you.
Complete the checklist, capture a demo, and reflect on your wins.

---

## Final Deliverables

1. **Fully functioning app**: Home, saved, and detail routes with filters and
   saved state. No console warnings/errors.
2. **Documentation**: README, module release notes, accessibility audit, smoke
   test script.
3. **Demo**: Loom video (≤ 3 minutes) showing user flows and architecture
   highlights.
4. **Retro**: Reflection on what you learned and what you'd improve next.

---

## Task · Ship the MVP

1. Run `npm run build` to ensure production build passes.
2. Record the Loom walkthrough (narrate filters, saved stays, detail page, retry
   states).
3. Create `docs/retrospectives/m4.md` answering:
   -  What did I learn?
   -  What slowed me down?
   -  What will I tackle next?
4. Tag a release in Git (`git tag v0.4.0 && git push --tags`).
5. Commit with `git commit -am "chore: finalize staysense mvp"`.

      ## What I Learned
      - Routing unlocked multi-page flows with minimal boilerplate.
      - Mock APIs provide production-like feedback without backend stress.

      ## What Slowed Me Down
      - Debugging dependency arrays—added ESLint hook plugin to help.

      ## Next Steps
      - Explore authentication using the mock token helpers in Project React docs.
      - Deploy to Vercel and set up CI for lint/test.
      ```

      ```bash
      npm run build
      git add docs/retrospectives/m4.md
      git commit -m "chore: finalize staysense mvp"
      git tag v0.4.0
      git push --tags
      ```
