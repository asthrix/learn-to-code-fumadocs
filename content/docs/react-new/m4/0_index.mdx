# Module 4 · Project Assembly

You now have an interactive, API-backed listings page. Module 4 wraps everything
into a demo-worthy MVP with detail pages, navigation, accessibility polish, and
launch notes.

---

## What You Will Build

-  A router-powered detail view for listings.
-  Navigation to switch between home and saved stays.
-  Accessibility improvements, meta tags, and shareable preview assets.
-  A project README + Loom walkthrough.

---

## Lesson Roadmap

1. **Lesson 1 – Project brief**: final requirements & success metrics.
2. **Lesson 2 – Detail page**: build the `/listing/:id` view.
3. **Lesson 3 – Polish & accessibility**: ensure keyboard, colour, and metadata
   standards.
4. **Lesson 4 – Launch checklist**: gather artifacts and testing steps.
5. **Lesson 5 – Module task**: deliver the final demo and retrospective.

## Success Criteria

-  Routing works seamlessly between home, saved, and detail views.
-  StaySense passes basic accessibility checks (keyboard, alt text, contrast).
-  README captures setup instructions, tech stack, and future work.
-  Loom walkthrough demonstrates the MVP end to end.
