# Launch Checklist & Artifacts

A great project includes documentation and proof of functionality. This lesson
packages everything you need before the final milestone.

---

## 1. README Essentials

Ensure `README.md` covers:

-  Project summary + screenshot or GIF.
-  Tech stack and key dependencies.
-  Setup instructions (`npm install`, env requirements).
-  Available scripts (dev, build, preview).
-  Learning outcomes / future roadmap.

---

## 2. Smoke Test Script

Create `scripts/smoke-test.md` documenting manual QA steps:

1. Load `/` → expect hero & listings after skeletons.
2. Apply filters (Cabin, price ≤ 300, guests ≥ 4) → results update.
3. Save two listings → saved count increments; refresh persists.
4. Navigate to `/saved` → saved listings only; unsave updates state.
5. Open detail page → gallery, description, CTA render.
6. Run accessibility check → skip link, focus states visible.

---

## 3. Demo Assets

-  Record a 2-minute Loom demonstrating filters, saved stays, and detail view.
-  Export a high-resolution screenshot for README/social sharing.
-  Optionally create a GIF using `ffmpeg` or `ScreenToGif`.

---

## Task · Assemble Launch Folder

1. Create `docs/launch/README-notes.md` summarising what changed since Module 3.
2. Add `scripts/smoke-test.md` and a placeholder for Loom URL.
3. Update project `README.md` with screenshot + Loom link.
4. Commit with `git commit -am "docs: add launch checklist artifacts"`.
