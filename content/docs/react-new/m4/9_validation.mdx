# Validating Module 4

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Confirm every route renders and handles deep links.
-  [ ] Validate accessibility (focus, skip links, keyboard navigation).
-  [ ] Test deployment rewrites and 404 fallback behaviour.
-  [ ] Record follow-up tasks for Modules 5‚Äì7.

## Project Context

Routing introduces new failure modes. A disciplined validation pass ensures
TaskFlow Pro is production-ready before moving on to performance and state
management enhancements.

---

## Testing Navigation

1. Navigate through sidebar links (Dashboard ‚Üí Projects ‚Üí Settings).
2. Refresh on `/projects/:projectId` to confirm deep link support.
3. Share a filtered dashboard URL (`?status=completed`) and open it in a new
   window.

---

## Accessibility Checklist

-  Tab through links; focus should move logically.
-  Trigger skip navigation to jump to main content.
-  Confirm `<RouteChangeTracker>` sets focus on headings.
-  Use Lighthouse or Axe to ensure 0 critical navigation issues.

---

## Deployment Rehearsal

-  Run `npm run build` and preview with `npm run preview` (or serve dist).
-  Verify rewrite rules handle unknown routes without server 404s.
-  Confirm 404 page offers a link back to `/dashboard`.

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Automate Smoke Tests

**Why:** Add Cypress or Playwright smoke tests for core routes.

### 2. Track Known Gaps

**Why:** Document TODOs (e.g., auth guard scenarios) for future modules.

---

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Skipping Slow-Network Checks

**Problem:** Lazy routes flash blank screens.

**Solution:** Simulate throttled networks and ensure skeletons appear.

### 2. Assuming Rewrites Work in Production

**Problem:** Local builds differ from hosting defaults.

**Solution:** Test on a staging deployment or with hosting CLI.

---

## üî® Implement in TaskFlow Pro

Perform the validation pass:

1. Use your browser + dev tools to execute the navigation steps above.
2. Run `npm run build && npm run preview` (or equivalent) to simulate
   production.
3. Update `notes/module-4-routing-plan.md` with a "Validation" section
   summarizing results and TODOs.
4. Commit with `git commit -am "chore: validate module 4 routing"`.

<Accordions type='single' className='mt-4'>

      <p>Capture validation outcomes so future modules know the routing baseline.</p>

      ```md filename="notes/module-4-routing-plan.md"
      ## Validation Summary
      - Deep links (`/projects/acme`) refresh correctly ‚úÖ
      - Filter URLs restore state ‚úÖ
      - Settings guard currently redirects unauthenticated users (mocked) ‚úÖ
      - TODO: Add Cypress smoke test for route access (Module MX)
      ```

      ```bash
      npm run build && npm run preview
      git add notes/module-4-routing-plan.md
      git commit -m "chore: validate module 4 routing"
      ```

   </Accordion>
</Accordions>

#### Expected Result

Routing now has a documented validation trail, enabling confident iteration in
future modules.

---

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

### Functionality

-  [ ] All routes render with correct layouts and data.
-  [ ] Deep links and query params work after refresh.

### Code Quality

-  [ ] Validation notes live alongside the routing plan.
-  [ ] Remaining tasks are documented for later modules.

### Understanding

-  [ ] You can explain how routing behaves under production build.
-  [ ] You know how to simulate throttled networks to test skeletons.

### Project Integration

-  [ ] Build/preview ensures deployment readiness ahead of Module 8.
-  [ ] TODOs reference upcoming modules (performance, auth).
