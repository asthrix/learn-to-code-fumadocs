# Routing in React

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Evaluate routing libraries (React Router, Next.js Router, TanStack
       Router).
-  [ ] Select React Router for TaskFlow Pro and note why.
-  [ ] Understand how routes interact with Module 2/3 state.
-  [ ] Outline opportunities for lazy loading in future lessons.

## Project Context

TaskFlow Pro ships as a standalone SPA. React Router remains the industry
standard and aligns with job expectations. Even though the repo runs in Next.js,
lessons teach transferable patterns via React Router in a sandboxed SPA version
of the app.

## Routing Options Overview

| Library            | Strengths                              | Trade-offs                           |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| React Router       | Mature, extensive docs, nested layouts | Manual data loaders, opinionated API |
| TanStack Router    | Type-safe, data-first APIs             | Smaller ecosystem, early adoption    |
| Next.js App Router | Server-first, file-based routing       | Requires Next.js runtime             |

React Router offers the right balance for a beginner-friendly SPA while leaving
room to adopt Next.js or TanStack Router later.

## React Router Concepts to Master

-  `BrowserRouter`: top-level provider handling history.
-  `Routes` / `Route`: declarative route matching.
-  `Outlet`: renders child routes within layouts.
-  `Link` / `NavLink`: navigation components.
-  Hooks like `useNavigate`, `useLocation`, `useParams`.

### Basic Example

```tsx
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";

function AppRouter() {
   return (
      <BrowserRouter>
         <Routes>
            <Route path='/' element={<DashboardPage />} />
            <Route path='projects' element={<ProjectsPage />} />
         </Routes>
      </BrowserRouter>
   );
}
```

### Practical Example

```tsx
<Route element={<AppLayout />}>
   <Route path='dashboard' element={<DashboardPage />} />
   <Route path='projects' element={<ProjectsPage />} />
   <Route path='projects/:projectId' element={<ProjectDetailPage />} />
</Route>
```

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Single Router, Many Layouts

**Why:** Wrap the app once in `BrowserRouter` and nest layouts to match the UI
tree.

### 2. Keep State in Hooks, Not Routes

**Why:** Let `useTasksState` handle data while routes handle structure.

---

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Mixing Router Versions

**Problem:** Using v5 patterns (`Switch`) with v6 APIs causes runtime errors.

**Solution:** Confirm the docs for the version you install (v6 in this course).

### 2. Hardcoding URLs in Multiple Places

**Problem:** Changing a path requires updates everywhere.

**Solution:** Centralize route constants.

```ts
export const routes = {
   dashboard: "/dashboard",
   projects: "/projects",
};
```

---

## üî® Implement in TaskFlow Pro

Prepare the SPA for React Router:

1. Install dependencies in the sandbox project:
   `npm install react-router-dom@6`.
2. Create `src/router/routes.ts` exporting named route constants and helper
   functions for nested paths.
3. Update `src/App.tsx` to render `<AppRouter />` (placeholder) while keeping
   existing UI for now.
4. Commit with `git commit -am "chore: prepare react router"`.

      <p>Lay the groundwork so future lessons can focus on wiring pages.</p>

      ```ts filename="src/router/routes.ts"
      export const routes = {
         root: "/",
         dashboard: "/dashboard",
         projects: "/projects",
         project: (projectId: string) => `/projects/${projectId}`,
         settings: "/settings",
         settingsProfile: "/settings/profile",
         settingsNotifications: "/settings/notifications",
      } as const;
      ```

      ```tsx filename="src/App.tsx"
      import { AppRouter } from "@/router/AppRouter";

      export function App() {
         return <AppRouter />;
      }
      ```

      ```bash
      npm install react-router-dom@6
      git add package.json package-lock.json src/router/routes.ts src/App.tsx
      git commit -m "chore: prepare react router"
      ```

   </Accordion>
</Accordions>

#### Expected Result

The project is ready to accept React Router routes with shared constants and an
entry point component.

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

### Functionality

-  [ ] Route constants cover current and future paths.
-  [ ] App renders the placeholder router without errors.

### Code Quality

-  [ ] Router setup lives in `src/router` to avoid cluttering components.
-  [ ] Dependencies use React Router v6.

### Understanding

-  [ ] You can articulate why React Router fits TaskFlow Pro.
-  [ ] You know how routes intersect with existing state hooks.

### Project Integration

-  [ ] Route constants align with Module 4 plan.
-  [ ] App entry point defers layout rendering to upcoming lessons.
