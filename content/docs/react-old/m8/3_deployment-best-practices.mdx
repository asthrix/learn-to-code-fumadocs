# Deployment Best Practices

## Monitoring & Alerts

-  Enable error tracking via Sentry (`SENTRY_DSN`).
-  Configure uptime checks on `/health` endpoint.
-  Alert on 5xx rates above 1% for five minutes.
-  Track Core Web Vitals using Vercel Analytics.

---

## Rollback Strategy

1. Keep the last three successful deployments tagged in Vercel.
2. Use `vercel rollback <deployment-id>` when critical regressions appear.
3. Maintain feature flags in `TASKFLOW_FEATURE_FLAGS` to disable risky surfaces.

```bash
# Rollback example
vercel rollback taskflow-pro-abc123
```

## Release Governance

| Step               | Owner         | Tooling                   |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ------------------------- |
| PR Approval        | Tech Lead     | GitHub Reviews            |
| Preview QA         | QA Lead       | Vercel Preview + TestRail |
| Security Sign-off  | Security Team | Checklist in Notion       |
| Production Release | On-call Dev   | `vercel promote` CLI      |

-  Document approvals in the release notes.
-  Rotate on-call engineers weekly.

---

## Capacity Planning

-  Review Vercel bandwidth usage after each release.
-  Ensure database connection pools align with expected traffic.
-  Cache static assets using `Cache-Control` headers.
-  Schedule load testing quarterly to validate scaling assumptions.

---

## âœ… Validation Checklist

-  [ ] Monitoring dashboards created for auth, forms, and API health.
-  [ ] Rollback procedure tested on staging.
-  [ ] Governance checklist completed and stored centrally.
-  [ ] Capacity metrics documented with thresholds.
