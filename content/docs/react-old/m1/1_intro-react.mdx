# Introduction to React

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Define React as a library for building user interfaces.
-  [ ] Summarise the virtual DOM and why it matters.
-  [ ] Connect React concepts to TaskFlow Pro features.
-  [ ] Bookmark key documentation to use throughout the course.

## Project Context

React is the engine behind TaskFlow Pro. Understanding its mindset helps you
design components that scale gracefully as the project grows.

## What Is React?

React is a declarative JavaScript library for building fast, interactive user
interfaces. It was created at Meta and is now maintained by a massive
open-source community.

### Why Declarative?

Declarative UI lets you describe _what_ the interface should look like for a
given state, and React handles _how_ to update the DOM efficiently.

### Basic Example

```tsx
function Greeting() {
   return <h1 className='text-2xl font-semibold'>Welcome back!</h1>;
}
```

### Practical Example

```tsx
import type { User } from "@/types";

type WelcomeProps = { user: User | null };

export function WelcomeBanner({ user }: WelcomeProps) {
   return (
      <section className='rounded-lg border bg-card p-6'>
         <h2 className='text-xl font-semibold'>
            {user ? `Hello, ${user.firstName}` : "Welcome to TaskFlow Pro"}
         </h2>
         <p className='mt-2 text-sm text-muted-foreground'>
            React makes it simple to render different UI based on state.
         </p>
      </section>
   );
}
```

## The Virtual DOM at a Glance

React keeps a lightweight representation of the DOM in memory. When state
changes, it diffs the new tree against the previous one and applies the minimal
number of updates to the real DOM.

-  Fewer direct DOM manipulations ‚Üí better performance.
-  Predictable rendering ‚Üí easier to reason about UI changes.

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Think in Components

**Why:** Breaking the UI into small pieces keeps code reusable and testable.

```tsx
function TaskList() {
   return (
      <div>
         <TaskFilters />
         <TaskItems />
      </div>
   );
}
```

### 2. Keep Source of Truth Centralised

**Why:** Single state sources help React reconcile updates without surprises.

```tsx
const [tasks, setTasks] = useState<Task[]>(initialTasks);
```

---

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Treating React Like jQuery

**Problem:** Direct DOM manipulation conflicts with React's rendering.

```tsx
// Bad
document.querySelector("#task-count").textContent = "5";
```

**Solution:** Let React render based on state.

```tsx
<p id='task-count'>{tasks.length}</p>
```

### 2. Ignoring Official Docs

**Problem:** Outdated tutorials cause confusion.

**Solution:** Rely on [react.dev](https://react.dev) for up-to-date guidance.

## üî® Implement in TaskFlow Pro

### Task: Create a React Reference Note

1. Add `notes/react-foundations.md`.
2. Document definitions for "component", "state", and "props".
3. List three features in TaskFlow Pro that React enables (e.g., dynamic task
   lists).
4. Commit with `git commit -am "docs: add react foundations notes"`.

<Accordions type='single' className='mt-4'>
   <Accordion title='Solution Walkthrough'>
      <p>
         Create the notes file and capture how React powers TaskFlow Pro.
         Here's a concise example you can adapt to your product vision.
      </p>

      ```md
      # React Foundations

      ## Core Terms
      - **Component**: Reusable UI building block; our Header, Sidebar, and TaskCard are components that render based on props.
      - **State**: Data that changes over time; TaskFlow Pro tracks task status, filters, and active workspace via state.
      - **Props**: Read-only inputs passed to components; TaskCard receives a task object, display variant, and callbacks.

      ## TaskFlow Pro Examples
      - The dashboard header re-renders when the active workspace name changes.
      - Sidebar links highlight the current view without manual DOM updates.
      - Task cards show priority badges and due dates sourced from React state.
      ```

      <p className='mt-3'>Stage and commit once the content mirrors your language:</p>

      ```bash
      git add notes/react-foundations.md
      git commit -m "docs: add react foundations notes"
      ```

   </Accordion>
</Accordions>

#### Expected Result

You now have a quick-reference guide to reinforce core terminology while coding.
