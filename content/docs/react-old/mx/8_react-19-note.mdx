## Migration Plan

1. Create a React 19 branch and run
   `npx @next/codemod@latest next-setup-react-19` (once available).
2. Update testing snapshots and adjust Suspense boundaries.
3. Validate server actions with TaskFlow Pro APIs.
4. Roll out behind feature flag `react19_enabled`.

## Testing Strategy

-  Run full Cypress suite plus manual smoke for drag-and-drop.
-  Monitor hydration warnings in browser console.
-  Capture performance metrics pre/post upgrade.
