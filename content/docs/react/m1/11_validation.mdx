# Module 1 Validation

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Confirm Header, Sidebar, and TaskCard behave as intended.
-  [ ] Validate UI against design tokens and responsive requirements.
-  [ ] Update documentation, notes, and TODOs.
-  [ ] Identify skills to reinforce before Module 2.

## Project Context

Quality gates ensure TaskFlow Pro stays production-ready. Completing this
checklist gives you confidence to move into state and events next.

---

## Validation Categories

### UI & Layout

-  Header displays workspace name, actions, and scales down gracefully.
-  Sidebar navigation highlights active items and retains spacing.
-  Task cards show priority, description, and due date.

### Responsiveness

-  Layout adapts to 1280px, 1024px, and 768px widths.
-  Buttons remain accessible and do not wrap awkwardly.

### Accessibility

-  Interactive elements have accessible names (`aria-label` where needed).
-  Color contrast meets WCAG AA (check using browser tools).

### Documentation

-  `docs/ui-components.md` reflects final props and styling decisions.
-  `docs/status/m1.md` summarises outcomes, blockers, and next steps.

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Run a Manual QA Pass

**Why:** Real clicks catch issues automated checks miss.

```md
-  Click every CTA (New task, View roadmap)
-  Keyboard navigate through header and sidebar
```

### 2. Capture Screenshots

**Why:** Provides visual baseline for future regressions.

```md
Attach screenshots to status notes or project management tool.
```

---

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Skipping Lint Before Validation

**Problem:** Hidden warnings slip into next module.

**Solution:** Run `npm run lint` and resolve all issues.

### 2. Ignoring Accessibility Checks

**Problem:** UI becomes unusable for keyboard or screen reader users.

**Solution:** Run Lighthouse or the browser's accessibility inspector.

## üî® Implement in TaskFlow Pro

### Task: Finalise Module 1

1. Run `npm run lint`, `npm run format -- --check`, and `npm run build`.
2. Test responsiveness using Chrome dev tools device toolbar.
3. Update `notes/m1-retro.md` with wins, challenges, and questions.
4. Commit with `git commit -am "chore: complete m1 validation"`.

<Accordions type='single' className='mt-4'>
   <Accordion title='Solution Walkthrough'>
      <p>
         Run the quality gates and capture learnings before entering Module 2 so the
         project stays production-ready.
      </p>

      ```bash
      npm run lint
      npm run format -- --check
      npm run build
      ```

      ```md filename="notes/m1-retro.md"
      # Module 1 Retro

      ## Wins
      - Header + Sidebar ship responsive UI with Tailwind tokens.
      - TaskCard leverages shared Badge component.

      ## Challenges
      - Need clearer strategy for loading states (address in Module 2).

      ## Questions
      - Should priority badges map to custom icons?
      ```

      ```bash
      git status
      git add .
      git commit -m "chore: complete m1 validation"
      ```

   </Accordion>
</Accordions>

#### Expected Result

You have a clean commit history, polished UI, and documentation ready for
Module 2.
