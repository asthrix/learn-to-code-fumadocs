# Lesson 3: Adding Property Data

Now that we have a HomePage component, let's add some actual property data to
display. You'll learn how to work with JavaScript arrays and objects inside
React components.

---

## Current State

Right now, the HomePage shows placeholder text: "Property listings will go
here...". We need real property data to display!

---

## Understanding the Data Structure

Each property in our booking app needs several pieces of information:

```javascript title="Property Data Structure"
{
  id: 1,
  title: "Cozy Beach House",
  location: "Malibu, California",
  price: 250,
  rating: 4.9,
  image: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1..."
}
```

**Why these fields?**

-  `id` - Unique identifier (we'll need this later for React keys)
-  `title` - Property name
-  `location` - Where it is
-  `price` - Cost per night
-  `rating` - Average guest rating
-  `image` - Photo URL

---

## Step 1: Create the Properties Array

Update your `HomePage.jsx` to include property data:

```jsx title="src/pages/HomePage.jsx"
function HomePage() {
   // Property data array
   const properties = [
      {
         id: 1,
         title: "Cozy Beach House",
         location: "Malibu, California",
         price: 250,
         rating: 4.9,
         image: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1499793983690-e29da59ef1c2?w=800",
      },
      {
         id: 2,
         title: "Modern Downtown Loft",
         location: "New York, NY",
         price: 180,
         rating: 4.7,
         image: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1502672260266-1c1ef2d93688?w=800",
      },
      {
         id: 3,
         title: "Mountain Cabin Retreat",
         location: "Aspen, Colorado",
         price: 320,
         rating: 5.0,
         image: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1518732714860-b62714ce0c59?w=800",
      },
      {
         id: 4,
         title: "Lakefront Villa",
         location: "Lake Tahoe, Nevada",
         price: 400,
         rating: 4.8,
         image: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1566073771259-6a8506099945?w=800",
      },
   ];

   return (
      <div className='home-page'>
         <header className='hero'>
            <h1>Find Your Perfect Stay</h1>
            <p>Discover amazing places to stay around the world</p>
         </header>

         <section className='listings'>
            <h2>Featured Properties</h2>
            <p>We have {properties.length} properties available</p>
         </section>
      </div>
   );
}

export default HomePage;
```

---

## What Changed?

### 1. Added Property Data

```jsx title="Properties Array"
const properties = [
  { id: 1, title: "...", ... },
  { id: 2, title: "...", ... },
  // ... more properties
];
```

This creates an array of objects. Each object represents one property with all
its details.

### 2. Used JavaScript in JSX

```jsx title="Using JavaScript in JSX"
<p>We have {properties.length} properties available</p>
```

**The curly braces `{}` let you use JavaScript inside JSX:**

-  `properties.length` is a JavaScript expression
-  It evaluates to `4` (the number of items in the array)
-  React renders it as plain text

---

## Why Define Data Inside the Component?

<Accordions type='single'>
   <Accordion id='scope' title='Component Scope' value='scope'>
      Data defined inside a component is only available to that component.
      Later, we'll move this data outside or fetch it from an API, but for
      learning, keeping it local is simpler.
   </Accordion>

<Accordion id='practice' title='Learning Step' value='practice'>
   We're starting with hardcoded data to focus on React concepts. In Module 3,
   you'll fetch this data from a real API!
</Accordion>

   <Accordion id='realistic' title='Realistic Structure' value='realistic'>
      This data structure mirrors what you'd get from a real backend API. When
      we switch to API calls, we'll only change how we get the data, not its
      structure.
   </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## JavaScript in JSX Rules

You can use any JavaScript expression inside `{}`:

<Steps>
   <Step>
      ### Variables
      
      ```jsx title="Using Variables in JSX"
      const name = "StayScape";
      <h1>{name}</h1>
      // Renders: <h1>StayScape</h1>
      ```
   </Step>

   <Step>
      ### Math Operations
      
      ```jsx title="Math in JSX"
      const price = 250;
      <p>${price * 7} per week</p>
      // Renders: <p>$1750 per week</p>
      ```
   </Step>

   <Step>
      ### String Methods
      
      ```jsx title="String Manipulation"
      const title = "beach house";
      <h2>{title.toUpperCase()}</h2>
      // Renders: <h2>BEACH HOUSE</h2>
      ```
   </Step>

   <Step>
      ### Ternary Operators
      
      ```jsx title="Conditional Rendering"
      const rating = 4.9;
      <span>{rating >= 4.5 ? "⭐ Superhost" : "Host"}</span>
      // Renders: <span>⭐ Superhost</span>
      ```
   </Step>
</Steps>

**What you CAN'T use:**

-  ❌ `if/else` statements (use ternary instead)
-  ❌ `for` loops (use `.map()` instead - next lesson!)
-  ❌ Multi-line statements (use expressions)

---

## Understanding the Data

Let's break down one property object:

```javascript title="Property Object Structure"
{
  id: 1,                    // Unique number
  title: "Cozy Beach House", // String
  location: "Malibu, CA",    // String
  price: 250,                // Number
  rating: 4.9,               // Number (decimal)
  image: "https://..."       // String (URL)
}
```

**Data Types Matter:**

-  Numbers don't need quotes: `price: 250`
-  Strings need quotes: `title: "Beach House"`
-  Use consistent formatting for readability

---

## Verify in Browser

Save your file and check the browser. You should see:

-  "Find Your Perfect Stay" heading
-  "We have 4 properties available" text

The number `4` comes from `properties.length`!

---

## Practice Challenge

Try these modifications to practice working with the data:

<Accordions type="single">
  <Accordion id="challenge1" title="Challenge 1: Add Another Property" value="challenge1">
    Add a 5th property to the array with your own details. Watch the count update automatically!
    
    ```jsx title="Adding New Property"
    {
      id: 5,
      title: "Your Property Name",
      location: "Your Location",
      price: 150,
      rating: 4.5,
      image: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1564013799919-ab600027ffc6?w=800",
    },
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion id="challenge2" title="Challenge 2: Calculate Total Value" value="challenge2">
    Display the total value of all properties per night:
    
    ```jsx title="Calculate Total"
    <p>
      Total value: ${properties.reduce((sum, prop) => sum + prop.price, 0)} per night
    </p>
    ```
    
    This uses `reduce()` to sum all prices. Renders: "Total value: $1150 per night"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion id="challenge3" title="Challenge 3: Show Highest Rated" value="challenge3">
    Find and display the highest rated property:
    
    ```jsx title="Find Top Rated"
    const topRated = properties.reduce((max, prop) => 
      prop.rating > max.rating ? prop : max
    );
    
    <p>Top rated: {topRated.title} ({topRated.rating}⭐)</p>
    ```
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Common Mistakes

<Accordions type="single">
  <Accordion id="mistake1" title="Forgetting Commas in Arrays" value="mistake1">
    ```jsx title="Common Array Syntax Error"
    // ❌ Missing comma after object
    const properties = [
      { id: 1, title: "House" }
      { id: 2, title: "Loft" }  // Error!
    ];
    
    // ✅ Correct: commas between items
    const properties = [
      { id: 1, title: "House" },
      { id: 2, title: "Loft" },
    ];
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion id="mistake2" title="Using Statements Instead of Expressions" value="mistake2">
    ```jsx title="JSX Expression Requirements"
    // ❌ Can't use if/else in JSX
    <p>
      {
        if (rating > 4) {
          return "Great";
        }
      }
    </p>
    
    // ✅ Use ternary operator
    <p>{rating > 4 ? "Great" : "Good"}</p>
    ```
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Checkpoint ✅

Before moving on, confirm:

-  ✅ Your HomePage has a `properties` array with 4 items
-  ✅ The page shows "We have 4 properties available"
-  ✅ No errors in the browser console
-  ✅ You understand how to use `{}` in JSX

---

## Next Up

Great! You have property data. Next, we'll create a `PropertyCard` component to
display individual properties using **props**.

<div className='mt-6 flex gap-4'>
   <Button variant='outline' asChild>
      <a href='/docs/react/m1/lesson-2'>← Previous: Creating HomePage</a>
   </Button>
   <Button asChild>
      <a href='/docs/react/m1/lesson-4'>Next: PropertyCard Component →</a>
   </Button>
</div>
