Welcome to your first React module! This is where your journey truly begins. ðŸš€

In this module, you'll learn the building blocks of every React application:
**components, JSX, and props**. By the end, you'll have a working homepage
displaying property listings.

---

## Overview

React applications are built from **components** - reusable pieces of UI. Think
of components like LEGO blocks: small, independent pieces that snap together to
create something bigger.

In this module, you'll build:

-  A `HomePage` component (the main page)
-  A `PropertyList` component (container for all listings)
-  A `PropertyCard` component (individual property display)

---

## What You'll Build

By the end of this module, your app will display a grid of property listings,
each showing:

-  Property image
-  Property title
-  Location
-  Price per night
-  Rating

It won't be interactive yet (that's Module 2!), but it will look like a real
booking website.

## Key Concepts

### JSX - JavaScript XML

JSX lets you write HTML-like code in JavaScript:

```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;
```

**It looks like HTML, but it's actually JavaScript.** React transforms it into
regular JavaScript function calls.

### Components

Components are JavaScript functions that return JSX:

```jsx
function Welcome() {
   return <h1>Welcome to StayScape!</h1>;
}
```

Every piece of UI in React is a component!

### Props

Props (short for "properties") let you pass data to components:

```jsx
function Greeting({ name }) {
   return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}

// Usage:
<Greeting name='Sarah' />;
// Renders: <h1>Hello, Sarah!</h1>
```

## Module Roadmap

Here's what we'll build step by step:

| Lesson | What You'll Create     | New Concepts                 |
| ------ | ---------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **1**  | Clean up Vite starter  | Project structure            |
| **2**  | HomePage component     | Components, JSX basics       |
| **3**  | Property data array    | JavaScript in JSX            |
| **4**  | PropertyCard component | Props, destructuring         |
| **5**  | PropertyList component | Mapping arrays, keys         |
| **6**  | Styling with Tailwind  | className, responsive design |
| **7**  | Composition & review   | Component architecture       |

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you:

-  âœ… Completed Module 0
-  âœ… Have a React project running with Vite
-  âœ… Can see the default Vite page in your browser
-  âœ… Have VS Code open with your project

---

## Project Structure

By the end of this module, your project will look like:

<Files>
   <Folder name='src' defaultOpen>
      <Folder name='pages' defaultOpen>
         <File name='HomePage.jsx' />
      </Folder>
      <Folder name='components' defaultOpen>
         <File name='PropertyList.jsx' />
         <File name='PropertyCard.jsx' />
      </Folder>
      <File name='App.jsx' />
      <File name='main.jsx' />
   </Folder>
</Files>

## Quick Refresher: JavaScript You'll Need

This module uses these JavaScript concepts:

<Accordions type="single">
  <Accordion id="destructuring" title="Object Destructuring" value="destructuring">
    ```javascript
    // Instead of this:
    function greet(props) {
      return props.name;
    }
    
    // We use this:
    function greet({ name }) {
      return name;
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion id="arrow" title="Arrow Functions" value="arrow">
    ```javascript
    // Traditional function:
    function add(a, b) {
      return a + b;
    }
    
    // Arrow function:
    const add = (a, b) => a + b;
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion id="template" title="Template Literals" value="template">
    ```javascript
    const name = "John";
    const greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`;
    // Result: "Hello, John!"
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion id="map" title="Array.map()" value="map">
    ```javascript
    const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
    const doubled = numbers.map(num => num * 2);
    // Result: [2, 4, 6]
    ```
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>
