# Form UX Best Practices

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Improve form copy for clarity and confidence.
-  [ ] Use layout patterns that reduce cognitive load.
-  [ ] Offer feedback (success, inline hints) appropriately.
-  [ ] Track UX metrics for ongoing optimization.

## Copy Guidelines

-  Lead with user benefit (“Create your TaskFlow workspace”).
-  Avoid jargon; prefer action verbs.
-  Provide inline helper text for complex fields (password rules).
-  Offer success state copy (“Check your inbox for a confirmation link”).

---

## Layout Patterns

-  Single column forms for sequential tasks.
-  Group related fields with headings.
-  Use progressive disclosure for optional sections.
-  Maintain generous spacing for readability.

---

## Feedback Strategy

-  Inline validation after blur, not on every keypress.
-  Summary alert for multi-error submissions.
-  Toast/inline success message after submission.
-  Provide links to retry or support when failures occur.
