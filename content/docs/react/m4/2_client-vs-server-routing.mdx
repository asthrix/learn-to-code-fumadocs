# Client vs Server Routing

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Explain how server-rendered navigation differs from client-side routing.
-  [ ] Identify benefits and drawbacks of each approach for TaskFlow Pro.
-  [ ] Decide where progressive enhancement or SSR may be needed.
-  [ ] Capture deployment considerations (caching, fallback routes).

## Project Context

TaskFlow Pro targets single-page responsiveness. Understanding routing models
ensures the course picks the right tool today while leaving doors open for
future SSR or static generation.

---

## Routing Models

-  **Server-side routing:** Each navigation triggers a full request/response
   cycle.
-  **Client-side routing:** JavaScript intercepts link clicks and swaps views
   without full page reloads.

### Basic Comparison

| Feature           | Server Routing       | Client Routing                |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Navigation speed  | Dependent on network | Near-instant after first load |
| SEO               | Strong by default    | Requires pre-rendering        |
| State persistence | Reset per request    | Maintains state between views |

### Practical Example

-  **Server:** `/dashboard` hits `GET /dashboard`, returns HTML.
-  **Client:** `/dashboard` updates React Router state; API calls fetch data.

---

## TaskFlow Pro Decision

We adopt **client-side routing** for Modules 4‚Äì6 because:

-  Students learn React Router patterns widely used in SPAs.
-  TaskFlow Pro already fetches data via API calls.
-  We control skeletons, optimistic updates, and caching without full refreshes.

Server rendering stays on the roadmap for Module 8 when we discuss deployment.

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Provide Meaningful Fallbacks

**Why:** Users on slow networks should still receive helpful content.

```html
<noscript>Please enable JavaScript to use TaskFlow Pro.</noscript>
```

### 2. Mirror Routes on the Server

**Why:** Hosting providers (Netlify, Vercel) need rewrite rules so deep links
resolve.

```plaintext
/*    /index.html   200
```

---

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Ignoring 404 Handling

**Problem:** Without rewrites, refreshing `/projects` returns a server 404.

**Solution:** Configure fallback routing rules during deployment.

### 2. Forgetting Analytics Requirements

**Problem:** Client-side navigations do not trigger traditional pageview
tracking.

**Solution:** Fire analytics events inside a route change listener.

---

## üî® Implement in TaskFlow Pro

Document routing decisions and deployment considerations:

1. Update `notes/module-4-routing-plan.md` with a "Routing Model" section
   summarizing why TaskFlow Pro uses client-side routing.
2. Add deployment notes (rewrites, `index.html` fallback, analytics hooks).
3. Create `docs/routing-deployment-checklist.md` listing items to verify before
   launch.
4. Commit with `git commit -am "docs: record routing model"`.

      ## Routing Model
      - Client-side routing via React Router
      - Server rewrites: `/* -> /index.html`
      - Analytics: listen for route changes in `AppRouter` component
      - Fallback: `<noscript>` message and loading skeletons
      ```

      ```md filename="docs/routing-deployment-checklist.md"
      # Routing Deployment Checklist

      - [ ] Configure SPA fallback rewrites on hosting platform
      - [ ] Verify deep links (`/projects/:id`) work after refresh
      - [ ] Ensure analytics track client-side navigations
      - [ ] Add `<noscript>` message to root HTML
      - [ ] Test routing with JavaScript disabled (expect fallback copy)
      ```

      ```bash
      git add notes/module-4-routing-plan.md docs/routing-deployment-checklist.md
      git commit -m "docs: record routing model"
      ```

   </Accordion>
</Accordions>

#### Expected Result

The routing plan now documents architecture choices and deployment tasks.

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

### Functionality

-  [ ] Routing model section explains client vs server trade-offs.
-  [ ] Deployment checklist covers rewrites and analytics.

### Code Quality

-  [ ] Documentation files live with other notes.
-  [ ] Items are specific enough to action later.

### Understanding

-  [ ] You can justify client-side routing for TaskFlow Pro.
-  [ ] You know what to configure when deploying an SPA.

### Project Integration

-  [ ] Routing plan references analytics hooks from Modules 2‚Äì3.
-  [ ] Deployment checklist supports Module 8 work.
