# Introduction to Navigation

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Describe the user journeys routing will unlock in TaskFlow Pro.
-  [ ] List all top-level and nested routes targeted in Module 4.
-  [ ] Sketch which components own layout, navigation, and content.
-  [ ] Note unanswered questions that affect later modules (auth, deep links).

## Project Context

Tasks now persist thanks to Module 3. Module 4 organizes them across views:
dashboard analytics, project filters, and settings. A deliberate routing plan
keeps links predictable and prepares the codebase for authentication in
Module 7.

## Why Routing Matters

Single-page apps still need URL structure. Routing:

-  Creates shareable URLs so teammates can load task details directly.
-  Splits the UI into focused contexts (dashboard vs settings).
-  Enables code-splitting and performance optimizations in later modules.

### Basic Example

```plaintext
/
/projects
/settings
/projects/:projectId
```

### Practical Example

```plaintext
/dashboard -> Task overview and quick stats
/projects -> Filtered list by project
/projects/:projectId -> Task list scoped to a project
/settings/profile -> User preferences (future auth work)
```

---

## Route Inventory

Break the experience into layers:

-  **Top-level layout:** Header, Sidebar, outlet for page content.
-  **Primary routes:** `/dashboard`, `/projects`, `/settings`.
-  **Nested routes:** `/projects/:projectId`, `/settings/profile`,
   `/settings/notifications`.
-  **Fallbacks:** 404 page, loading states for lazy routes.

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Keep URLs Human-Friendly

**Why:** Descriptive paths (`/projects/inbox`) help users and search engines.

### 2. Co-locate Layouts with Routes

**Why:** Shared UI (sidebar, breadcrumbs) stays synced with navigation state.

```tsx
<Route element={<DashboardLayout />}>
   <Route path='dashboard' element={<DashboardPage />} />
</Route>
```

---

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Overloading a Single Route

**Problem:** Shoving multiple contexts into `/` makes URLs ambiguous.

**Solution:** Create dedicated routes, even if the UI looks similar.

### 2. Forgetting Nested Navigation

**Problem:** Settings tabs break when users refresh deep URLs.

**Solution:** Plan nested routes (`/settings/profile`) so each tab gets a URL.

## üî® Implement in TaskFlow Pro

Create a routing plan document:

1. Add `notes/module-4-routing-plan.md` outlining top-level, nested, and future
   routes.
2. Include a table with columns for `Path`, `Purpose`, `Layout`, `Notes`.
3. Highlight dependencies (e.g., requires authenticated user).
4. Commit with `git commit -am "docs: draft module 4 routing plan"`.

<Accordions type='single' className='mt-4'>
   <Accordion title='Solution Walkthrough'>
      <p>
         Capture the routing blueprint before touching code to keep Module 4 focused.
      </p>

      ```md filename="notes/module-4-routing-plan.md"
      # Module 4 ¬∑ Routing Plan

      | Path | Purpose | Layout | Notes |
      | --- | --- | --- | --- |
      | /dashboard | Default analytics view | DashboardLayout | Landing page after login |
      | /projects | Browse tasks by project | ProjectsLayout | Filters sidebar + list |
      | /projects/:projectId | Project details | ProjectsLayout | Loads project tasks |
      | /settings | Settings overview | SettingsLayout | Redirect to /settings/profile |
      | /settings/profile | Profile preferences | SettingsLayout | Requires auth (Module 7) |
      | /settings/notifications | Notification prefs | SettingsLayout | Placeholder for Module 7 |
      | * | 404 fallback | PublicLayout | Show helpful links |
      ```

      ```bash
      git add notes/module-4-routing-plan.md
      git commit -m "docs: draft module 4 routing plan"
      ```

   </Accordion>
</Accordions>

#### Expected Result

You now have a documented route inventory covering current goals and future
enhancements.

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

### Functionality

-  [ ] Route table covers dashboard, projects, settings, and 404.
-  [ ] Nested routes account for project detail and settings subpages.

### Code Quality

-  [ ] Document lives in `notes/` alongside earlier module plans.
-  [ ] Notes include dependencies for future modules.

### Understanding

-  [ ] You can explain how routing improves UX over a single page.
-  [ ] You know which layouts render for each route.

### Project Integration

-  [ ] Plan references existing components (Sidebar, Dashboard shell).
-  [ ] Auth-related paths are marked for Modules 7+.
