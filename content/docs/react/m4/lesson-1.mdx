title: "L1: Installing React Router"
description: "Set up React Router to enable multi-page navigation in your application"
---



Welcome to Module 4! In this module, you'll transform your single-page application into a multi-page website using React Router. Users will be able to navigate between different pages without full page reloads!

## What You'll Learn

- What client-side routing is and why it's important
- How React Router enables navigation in SPAs
- Installing and setting up React Router
- The difference between traditional and client-side routing

## Why We Need React Router

Right now, your entire application lives on one page. Everything happens at the URL `http://localhost:5173/`. But real websites have multiple pages:

- **Homepage** - Browse all listings
- **Listing Details** - View full information about one listing
- **Favorites** - See saved listings
- **User Profile** - Account settings
- **404 Page** - When page doesn't exist

### Traditional vs. Client-Side Routing

<Tabs items={['Traditional Routing', 'Client-Side Routing']}>

<Tab value="Traditional Routing">

**How traditional websites work:**

```
User clicks link
    ↓
Browser requests new HTML page from server
    ↓
Server sends entire HTML file
    ↓
Browser reloads page from scratch
    ↓
New page appears (with flash/flicker)
```

**Problems:**
- ❌ Full page reload (slow)
- ❌ Lose JavaScript state
- ❌ Flash of white screen
- ❌ Server must handle every route
- ❌ Wastes bandwidth

</Tab>

<Tab value="Client-Side Routing">

**How React Router works:**

```
User clicks link
    ↓
React Router intercepts the click
    ↓
Updates the URL (no server request)
    ↓
React renders the new component
    ↓
Content changes instantly (smooth)
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Instant navigation (fast)
- ✅ Keep JavaScript state
- ✅ Smooth transitions
- ✅ Works offline (PWA)
- ✅ Better user experience

## What is React Router?

**React Router** is the standard routing library for React. It allows you to:

- Define multiple pages (routes) in your app
- Navigate between pages without reloading
- Access URL parameters (like `/listing/123`)
- Handle 404 errors
- Create nested routes
- Protect routes (authentication)

Think of it as the "GPS" for your React application - it knows where you are and how to get anywhere else!

## How React Router Works

<Steps>

<Step>

#### Define Routes

Tell React Router which component to show for each URL:

```jsx title="Conceptual Example"
<Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<HomePage />} />
  <Route path="/listing/:id" element={<DetailsPage />} />
  <Route path="/favorites" element={<FavoritesPage />} />
</Routes>
```

</Step>

<Step>

#### React Router Watches the URL

When the URL changes, React Router:
1. Looks at the current URL
2. Finds the matching route
3. Renders the corresponding component

</Step>

<Step>

#### Components Navigate

Use special components to navigate:

```jsx title="Navigation Example"
// Link component - like <a> but without page reload
<Link to="/listing/5">View Listing</Link>

// Or programmatically
const navigate = useNavigate();
navigate('/favorites');
```

</Step>

</Steps>

## Installing React Router

Let's install React Router in your project!

<Steps>

<Step>

#### Stop Your Development Server

If your dev server is running, stop it with `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

</Step>

<Step>

#### Install the Package

Run this command in your terminal:

```bash title="Terminal"
npm install react-router-dom
```

**What's being installed:**

- `react-router-dom` - React Router for web browsers
- Latest version: 6.x (modern, hook-based API)

<Callout type="info">

**Note:** There's also `react-router-native` for React Native mobile apps, but we're using `react-router-dom` for web applications.

</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>

#### Wait for Installation

You'll see output like this:

```bash title="Terminal Output"
added 3 packages, and audited 200 packages in 5s

found 0 vulnerabilities
```

</Step>

<Step>

#### Verify Installation

Check that it was added to `package.json`:

```json title="package.json" {5}
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.3.1",
    "react-dom": "^18.3.1",
    "react-router-dom": "^6.22.0"
  }
}
```

</Step>

<Step>

#### Restart Development Server

Start your dev server again:

```bash title="Terminal"
npm run dev
```

</Step>

</Steps>

## What's Included in React Router?

When you install `react-router-dom`, you get these key exports:

<Accordions>

<Accordion title="Router Components">

**BrowserRouter** - The main router component that uses browser history

```jsx
import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';

<BrowserRouter>
  {/* Your routes go here */}
</BrowserRouter>
```

We'll use this in the next lesson!

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Route Configuration">

**Routes** - Container for all your routes

**Route** - Defines a single route (path + component)

```jsx
import { Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

<Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<HomePage />} />
  <Route path="/about" element={<AboutPage />} />
</Routes>
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Navigation Components">

**Link** - Navigate to a route (replaces `<a>` tags)

**NavLink** - Link with active state styling

```jsx
import { Link, NavLink } from 'react-router-dom';

<Link to="/home">Home</Link>

<NavLink 
  to="/about" 
  className={({ isActive }) => isActive ? 'active' : ''}
>
  About
</NavLink>
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Navigation Hooks">

**useNavigate** - Programmatically navigate

**useParams** - Get URL parameters

**useLocation** - Get current location object

**useSearchParams** - Work with query strings

```jsx
import { useNavigate, useParams } from 'react-router-dom';

// Programmatic navigation
const navigate = useNavigate();
navigate('/login');

// Get URL params
const { id } = useParams(); // From /listing/:id
```

</Accordion>

</Accordions>

## React Router Versions

<Callout type="warn" title="Version Differences">

React Router has had major API changes:

- **v5 and earlier** - Component-based API (`<Switch>`, render props)
- **v6 (current)** - Hook-based API (`<Routes>`, `element` prop)

Make sure you're following v6 tutorials! The syntax is different from older versions.

</Callout>

### v5 vs v6 Quick Comparison

<Tabs items={['React Router v6 (New)', 'React Router v5 (Old)']}>

<Tab value="React Router v6 (New)">

```jsx title="Modern API (v6)"
// [!code word:Routes]
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

<BrowserRouter>
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/" element={<HomePage />} />
    <Route path="/about" element={<AboutPage />} />
  </Routes>
</BrowserRouter>
```

**Key differences:**
- ✅ `<Routes>` instead of `<Switch>`
- ✅ `element` prop (JSX) instead of `component`
- ✅ All hooks included (useNavigate, useParams, etc.)
- ✅ Nested routes are easier
- ✅ Relative routing

</Tab>

<Tab value="React Router v5 (Old)">

```jsx title="Old API (v5)"
import { BrowserRouter, Switch, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

<BrowserRouter>
  <Switch>
    <Route exact path="/" component={HomePage} />
    <Route path="/about" component={AboutPage} />
  </Switch>
</BrowserRouter>
```

**Deprecated patterns:**
- ❌ `<Switch>` (now `<Routes>`)
- ❌ `component` prop (now `element`)
- ❌ `exact` keyword (automatic in v6)
- ❌ `useHistory` (now `useNavigate`)

</Tab>

</Tabs>

## Routing Terminology

Before we continue, let's define key terms:

<Accordions>

<Accordion title="Route">

A **route** is a URL path mapped to a component:

```jsx
<Route path="/listing/5" element={<ListingDetailsPage />} />
```

When user visits `/listing/5`, React Router renders `<ListingDetailsPage />`.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Path">

The **path** is the URL pattern:

```jsx
path="/"              // Homepage
path="/about"         // Static path
path="/listing/:id"   // Dynamic path with parameter
path="*"              // Catch-all (404)
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="URL Parameter">

A **URL parameter** is a variable part of the path:

```jsx
// Route definition
<Route path="/listing/:id" element={<Details />} />

// Matches these URLs:
/listing/1     // id = "1"
/listing/42    // id = "42"
/listing/abc   // id = "abc"
```

Access with `useParams()` hook.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Navigate / Navigation">

**Navigation** is moving from one route to another:

```jsx
// Declarative (with Link)
<Link to="/about">About</Link>

// Imperative (with hook)
const navigate = useNavigate();
navigate('/about');
```

</Accordion>

</Accordions>

## Your Application's Future Routes

Here's what we'll build in this module:

```
Route Structure
│
├─ /                          → HomePage
│  (Browse all listings)
│
├─ /listing/:id               → ListingDetailsPage
│  (View single listing)
│  Examples: /listing/1, /listing/42
│
└─ /*                         → NotFoundPage
   (404 - Page not found)
```

In later modules, we'll add:

```
├─ /favorites                 → FavoritesPage (Module 6)
├─ /sign-in                   → SignInPage (Module 7)
├─ /sign-up                   → SignUpPage (Module 7)
└─ /profile                   → ProfilePage (Module 7)
```

<Callout type="success" title="Installation Complete!">

React Router is now installed and ready to use! In the next lesson, we'll create the Router component and set up our first routes.
