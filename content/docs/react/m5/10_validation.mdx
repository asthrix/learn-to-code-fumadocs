# Validating Module 5

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Measure render timings with React DevTools profiler.
-  [ ] Confirm lazy-loaded panels and virtual lists behave on slow networks.
-  [ ] Run automated checks (lint, tests, type checks) after refactors.
-  [ ] Document performance baselines and TODOs.

## Project Context

Performance work is only done when the user experience is verified. This
validation pass ensures TaskFlow Pro remains stable and measurable after
memoisation and hook refactors.

---

## Profiling Checklist

1. Record a profiler session for dashboard interactions with 200+ tasks.
2. Compare commit durations before/after memoisation (target < 8 ms).
3. Inspect flame chart for repeated renders of memoised components.

---

## Behavioural Checks

-  Scroll through the virtualised task list; ensure items recycle correctly.
-  Toggle filters rapidly; deferred value should keep typing smooth.
-  Trigger analytics panel suspense fallback by throttling network to "Slow 3G".

---

## ✅ Best Practices

### 1. Automate Metrics Capture

Use `pnpm exec react-scan` or Lighthouse performance audits in CI.

### 2. Record Baselines

Store current FPS, memory, and interaction timings in project docs for
regression detection.

---

## ❌ Common Mistakes

### 1. Trusting Dev Builds

Validate using `npm run build && npm run start` to mimic production bundling.

### 2. Skipping Accessibility Checks

New lazy boundaries may break screen reader announcements—rerun Axe audit.

---

## 🔨 Implement in TaskFlow Pro

Complete the validation loop:

1. Run `npm run lint`, `npm run test`, and `npm run type-check` (or equivalent)
   to ensure stability.
2. Record profiler results and note timings in
   `notes/module-5-performance-plan.md` under "Validation".
3. Update `docs/performance-architecture.md` with the current baseline metrics.
4. Create GitHub issues (or TODOs) for remaining gaps (e.g., server-driven
   metrics) and link them from the notes file.
5. Commit with `git commit -am "chore: validate module 5 performance"`.

<Accordions type='single' className='mt-4'>
   <Accordion title='Solution Walkthrough'>
      <p>Ensure performance upgrades are measurable and documented.</p>

      ```bash
      npm run lint
      npm run test
      npm run type-check
      npm run build
      ```

      ```md filename="notes/module-5-performance-plan.md"
      ## Validation
      - React DevTools commit duration: 6.3 ms avg (dashboard filter)
      - Virtual list scroll FPS: 55–60 on mid-tier laptop
      - TODO: Automate profiler run in CI (Module MX)
      ```

      ```md filename="docs/performance-architecture.md"
      ## Baseline Metrics (2025-10-24)
      - Dashboard initial render: 1.2s (Slow 4G)
      - Filter interaction: < 80ms frame budget
      - Insights panel suspense fallback duration: 350ms
      ```

      ```bash
      git add notes/module-5-performance-plan.md docs/performance-architecture.md
      git commit -m "chore: validate module 5 performance"
      ```

#### Expected Result

Performance improvements are validated, documented, and ready for future
monitoring as TaskFlow Pro evolves.

## ✅ Validation Checklist

### Functionality

-  [ ] Virtual list, filters, and analytics behave in production mode.
-  [ ] Lazy boundaries show fallbacks without blocking navigation.

### Code Quality

-  [ ] Linting, tests, and type checks pass post-refactor.
-  [ ] Validation notes store metrics and TODOs.

### Understanding

-  [ ] You can explain performance improvements to stakeholders.
-  [ ] You know which metrics to monitor in future sprints.

### Project Integration

-  [ ] Architecture docs include baseline numbers.
-  [ ] Issues or TODOs track remaining optimisation ideas.
