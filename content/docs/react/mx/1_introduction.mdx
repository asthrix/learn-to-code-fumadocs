# Introduction to Extended Enhancements

## Backlog Overview

| Epic                     | Impact | Effort | Notes                        |
| ------------------------ | ------ | ------ | ---------------------------- |
| Drag-and-drop board      | High   | Medium | Improves daily task workflow |
| React Query caching      | High   | Medium | Enables optimistic updates   |
| Profiles & listings      | Medium | High   | Readies multi-user roll out  |
| Reviews & feedback       | Medium | Medium | Adds social proof            |
| Cypress regression suite | High   | Medium | Protects core experiences    |

## Prioritization Matrix

-  Start with features that reduce support load (React Query + testing).
-  Layer UI polish (drag-and-drop) after stability improvements.
-  Treat user-generated content (profiles/listings/reviews) as opt-in.
