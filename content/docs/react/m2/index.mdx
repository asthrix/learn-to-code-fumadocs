Welcome to Module 2! It's time to bring your application to life with
**interactivity**. 🎯

In Module 1, you built a static homepage. Now you'll add state management and
event handling to make it dynamic and responsive to user actions.

---

## Overview

**State** is data that can change over time. When state changes, React
automatically updates the UI to reflect those changes. Without state, your app
would always look the same!

**Events** are how users interact with your application - clicking buttons,
typing in inputs, selecting options. You'll learn to handle these events and
update state accordingly.

## What You'll Build

By the end of this module, your homepage will have:

<Steps>
   <Step>
      🔍 Search Functionality Users can search properties by name or location
   </Step>
   <Step>
      👥 Guest Selector Choose number of guests
   </Step>
   <Step>
      📅 Date Range Picker Select check-in and check-out dates
   </Step>
   <Step>
      ⚡ Real-time Filtering Listings update instantly as users interact with filters
   </Step>
</Steps>

## Key Concepts

### useState Hook

The `useState` hook lets you add state to functional components:

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
   const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

   return (
      <div>
         <p>Count: {count}</p>
         <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
      </div>
   );
}
```

### Event Handling

React uses camelCase event handlers:

```jsx
<button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>
<input onChange={handleChange} value={text} />
<form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>...</form>
```

### Controlled Components

Form inputs controlled by React state:

```jsx
const [name, setName] = useState("");

<input value={name} onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)} />;
```

## Quick Refresher

### JavaScript Concepts You'll Use

<Steps>
  <Step>
    #### Array Methods
    ```javascript
    const filtered = array.filter(item => item.price < 100);
    const found = array.find(item => item.id === 1);
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    #### Conditional Operators
    ```javascript
    const result = condition ? 'yes' : 'no';
    const value = input || 'default';
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    #### Event Objects
    ```javascript
    onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)}
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
