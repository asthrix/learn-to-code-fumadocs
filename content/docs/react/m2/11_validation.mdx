# Module 2 Validation

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Ensure task CRUD flows operate without errors.
-  [ ] Validate filters, search, and stats stay in sync.
-  [ ] Run linting and build checks after interactive changes.
-  [ ] Document Module 2 retrospective notes.

## Project Context

Module 2 introduced stateful complexity. Validation catches regressions before
moving to effects and data fetching in Module 3.

---

## Validation Categories

### Interactivity

-  Composer creates tasks, resets drafts, and shows errors for empty titles.
-  Toolbar filters/sorts tasks and search is case-insensitive.
-  Toggle, rename, and delete actions work end-to-end.

### UX

-  Inline editor focuses automatically and supports keyboard shortcuts.
-  Empty states communicate next actions.

### Documentation

-  Notes and playbooks reflect the final implementation.

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Re-test Each Handler After Refactors

**Why:** State updates are easy to break when adding new features.

### 2. Capture GIFs or Screenshots

**Why:** Visual records help future debugging and stakeholder updates.

---

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Skipping Lint/Type Checks

**Problem:** Runtime issues surface later in Module 3.

### 2. Forgetting Retro Notes

**Problem:** Learnings fade before the next module.

### Task: QA and Retro

1. Run `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, and `npm run format -- --check`.
2. Manually test task creation, filtering, toggling, renaming, and deletion.
3. Update `notes/m2-retro.md` with:
   -  Wins, challenges, and follow-up tasks
   -  Observations about state/handler patterns
4. Commit with `git commit -am "chore: complete m2 validation"`.

   <Accordion title='Solution Walkthrough'>
      <p>
         Run automated checks and capture learnings before advancing to Module 3.
      </p>

      ```bash
      npm run lint
      npm run format -- --check
      npm run build
      ```

      ```md filename="notes/m2-retro.md"
      # Module 2 Retro

      ## Wins
      - State visualizer made debugging easier.
      - `useTasksState` keeps handlers colocated.

      ## Challenges
      - Need better error messaging for rename failures.
      - Deletion confirmation flow planned for Module 3.

      ## Follow-ups
      - Integrate analytics tracking for key events.
      - Persist tasks to API once backend endpoints exist.
      ```

      ```bash
      git add notes/m2-retro.md
      git commit -m "chore: complete m2 validation"
      ```

#### Expected Result

Module 2 ends with verified interactions and documented improvements for the
next phase.

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

### Functionality

-  [ ] Automated commands succeed without errors.
-  [ ] Manual QA steps pass.

### Code Quality

-  [ ] No unused handlers or stale state remain.

### Understanding

-  [ ] You can highlight the biggest Module 2 learning.

### Project Integration

-  [ ] Retro notes outline follow-up work for Module 3.
