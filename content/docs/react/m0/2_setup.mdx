# Downloads & Setup Requirements

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Confirm your machine runs Node.js 18+ and npm 9+.
-  [ ] Install VS Code with React-focused extensions.
-  [ ] Configure Git name and email for clean history.
-  [ ] Verify everything through terminal commands.

## Project Context

TaskFlow Pro is a React + Vite project. Reliable tooling saves hours of
frustration later when linting or test scripts fail. We set up the environment
once and reuse it across every module.

---

## Core Installations

### Node.js + npm

Download the latest LTS release from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org). LTS
versions are stable, well-supported, and compatible with the course code.

### VS Code

Install from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com). Enable the
following extensions:

-  ES7 React/Redux snippets
-  Tailwind CSS IntelliSense
-  ESLint
-  Prettier ‚Äì Code formatter

### Git

Install from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com). On macOS you can also use
Homebrew: `brew install git`.

---

## Why Tooling Matters

### Consistency Across Modules

Shared tooling ensures every `npm run` script behaves the same for you and
future collaborators.

### Fast Feedback

Extensions like ESLint and Tailwind IntelliSense surface mistakes before you
switch to the browser.

### Basic Example

```bash
node --version
# Expected: v18.x.x or v20.x.x
npm --version
# Expected: 9.x.x or 10.x.x
```

### Practical Example

```bash
# macOS using Homebrew
brew install node
brew install git
code --install-extension dsznajder.es7-react-js-snippets
code --install-extension esbenp.prettier-vscode
```

Run these commands in your terminal to replicate the setup quickly on new
machines.

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Use LTS Releases

**Why:** Aligns with production environments and avoids breaking API changes.

```bash
nvm install --lts
nvm alias default 'lts/*'
```

### 2. Store Installer Links

**Why:** Saves time when reinstalling or helping teammates.

```md
-  Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/download
-  Git: https://git-scm.com/downloads
-  VS Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
```

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Mixing Package Managers

**Problem:** Swapping between `npm`, `yarn`, and `pnpm` causes lockfile
conflicts.

```bash
# Bad: creating a yarn.lock in a project configured for npm.
yarn install
```

**Solution:**

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Ignoring Git Identity

**Problem:** Commits show as ‚Äúunknown‚Äù in history.

```bash
# Bad: forgetting to set global name/email.
```

**Solution:**

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
```

## üî® Implement in TaskFlow Pro

### Task: Record Environment Details

1. Run `node --version`, `npm --version`, and `git --version`.
2. Create `notes/environment.md` with the command outputs.
3. Add a "Reinstall" section linking to the official download pages.
4. Commit with `git commit -am "docs: capture environment versions"`.

#### Expected Result

Future you (or a teammate) can quickly rebuild the environment or compare
versions when debugging.

---

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

### Functionality

-  [ ] Node.js, npm, and Git binaries respond in the terminal.
-  [ ] VS Code launches and shows the ESLint/Tailwind extensions.

### Code Quality

-  [ ] `notes/environment.md` is tracked in Git.
-  [ ] No stray lockfiles (only `package-lock.json`) exist.

### Understanding

-  [ ] You can explain why LTS releases are recommended.
-  [ ] You know which extension formats code automatically.

### Project Integration

-  [ ] Repository remote origin is configured (check `git remote -v`).
-  [ ] The notes file lists installer URLs for quick access.
