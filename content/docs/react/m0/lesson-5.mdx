You're almost ready to start coding! This final introductory lesson shares
strategies to help you succeed throughout the course.

---

## Learning Strategies

### 1. Code Along, Don't Just Read

**‚ùå Don't:** Just read the lessons without typing code  
**‚úÖ Do:** Open VS Code and code along with every lesson

```jsx
// Type this yourself, don't copy-paste initially
function Welcome() {
   return <h1>Hello React!</h1>;
}
```

**Why:** Muscle memory and active engagement help concepts stick.

### 2. Make Mistakes Intentionally

**Try breaking things to learn:**

-  Remove a closing `}` - what error do you get?
-  Change a prop name - how does React respond?
-  Delete an import - what breaks?

Understanding errors is just as important as writing correct code!

### 3. Build, Test, Verify

After each lesson:

<Steps>
   <Step>#### Write the Code Follow the lesson instructions</Step>
   <Step>#### Save and Check Browser Does it work as expected?</Step>
   <Step>#### Read Console Errors Fix any issues before continuing</Step>
   <Step>#### Experiment Try modifying something small</Step>
</Steps>

## Time Management

### Pace Yourself

<Accordions type='single'>
   <Accordion id='daily' title='Daily Schedule Suggestions' value='daily'>
      **Beginner Track (Modules 1-2):** - 30-60 minutes per day - 2-3 lessons
      per session - Complete in 2 weeks **Intermediate Track (Modules 3-4):** -
      60-90 minutes per day - 1-2 lessons per session - Complete in 2 weeks
      **Advanced Track (Modules 5-7):** - 90-120 minutes per day - 1-2 lessons
      per session - Complete in 3-4 weeks
   </Accordion>

   <Accordion id='weekend' title='Weekend Warrior Schedule' value='weekend'>
      - Focus on weekends for longer sessions - Review during weeknights (15-30
      minutes) - Complete modules on Saturday/Sunday - Practice and experiment
      during the week
   </Accordion>

   <Accordion
      id='intensive'
      title='Intensive Boot camp Style'
      value='intensive'
   >
      - 4-6 hours per day - Complete 1-2 modules per day - Finish entire course
      in 1-2 weeks - **Caution:** Can be overwhelming, take breaks!
   </Accordion>
</Accordions>

### Take Breaks

<Badge variant='danger'>Don't burn out!</Badge>

-  **Use the Pomodoro Technique:**

   -  25 minutes of focused coding
   -  5-minute break
   -  Repeat
   -  Longer break after 4 sessions

-  **Walk away when stuck:**
   -  Come back with fresh eyes
   -  Often solutions appear after a break

## Dealing with Challenges

### When You Get Stuck

<Steps>
   <Step>
      #### Read the Error Message Error messages tell you exactly what's wrong:
      ``` Error: Cannot find module './HomePage' ``` This means: The file path
      is wrong or the file doesn't exist.
   </Step>
   <Step>
      #### Check Your Code Compare line-by-line with the lesson example: -
      Spelling errors? - Missing punctuation? - Wrong file location?
   </Step>
   <Step>
      #### Use Console.log() Debug by logging values: ```jsx console.log('My
      variable:', myVariable); ```
   </Step>
   <Step>
      #### Google the Error Copy the error message and search: - Stack Overflow
      usually has answers - React docs are excellent
   </Step>
   <Step>
      #### Ask for Help Use course forums, Discord, or communities: - Be specific
      about the problem - Share your code - Explain what you've tried
   </Step>
</Steps>

### Common Beginner Mistakes

<Accordions type="single">
  <Accordion id="imports" title="Forgetting Imports" value="imports">
    ```jsx
    // ‚ùå Error: useState is not defined
    function Counter() {
      const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    }
    
    // ‚úÖ Correct: Import useState
    import { useState } from 'react';
    
    function Counter() {
      const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion id="export" title="Missing Exports" value="export">
    ```jsx
    // ‚ùå Can't import this component
    function Header() {
      return <header>...</header>;
    }
    
    // ‚úÖ Add export default
    function Header() {
      return <header>...</header>;
    }
    
    export default Header;
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion id="jsx" title="Forgetting JSX Rules" value="jsx">
    ```jsx
    // ‚ùå class instead of className
    <div class="container">
    
    // ‚úÖ Use className
    <div className="container">
    
    // ‚ùå Unclosed tag
    <img src="photo.jpg">
    
    // ‚úÖ Self-closing tag
    <img src="photo.jpg" />
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion id="state" title="Mutating State Directly" value="state">
    ```jsx
    // ‚ùå Never modify state directly
    const [user, setUser] = useState({ name: 'John' });
    user.name = 'Jane'; // Wrong!
    
    // ‚úÖ Use the setter function
    setUser({ ...user, name: 'Jane' });
    ```
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Best Practices

### Keep Your Code Organized

-  **One component per file**
-  **Use descriptive names** (`PropertyCard` not `Card1`)
-  **Group related files** (all pages in `/pages`, all components in
   `/components`)
-  **Delete unused code** (keep it clean!)

### Write Clean Code

```jsx
// ‚ùå Hard to read
function PropertyCard({ title, price, image, location }) {
   return (
      <div>
         <img src={image} />
         <h3>{title}</h3>
         <p>{location}</p>
         <span>${price}</span>
      </div>
   );
}

// ‚úÖ Easy to read
function PropertyCard({ title, price, image, location }) {
   return (
      <div className='property-card'>
         <img src={image} alt={title} />
         <h3>{title}</h3>
         <p>{location}</p>
         <span className='price'>${price}</span>
      </div>
   );
}
```

### Use Git for Version Control

Commit your code regularly:

```bash
# After completing a lesson
git add .
git commit -m "Complete Module 1 Lesson 3: Property Card component"

# Push to GitHub (optional but recommended)
git push origin main
```

**Benefits:**

-  Track your progress
-  Undo mistakes easily
-  Build a portfolio
-  Show your work to employers
