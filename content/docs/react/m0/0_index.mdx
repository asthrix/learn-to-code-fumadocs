## About This Course

### Project-Based Learning

Unlike traditional courses that teach concepts in isolation, you'll learn React
by building a **real-world booking application**. Every lesson adds a new
feature or improves existing functionality.

      - **Real Project**: Build a production-ready application, not toy examples
      - **Hands-On**: Write code in every lesson - **Incremental**: Each step
      builds on the previous - **Explained**: Understand the "why" behind every
      decision - **Modern**: Uses latest React patterns and best practices
