Welcome to your first lesson! Before we dive into React, let's make sure you
know how to navigate this course effectively.

---

## Course Navigation

The course interface is designed to be simple and intuitive:

### Sidebar Navigation

On the left side, you'll find:

-  **All modules** listed in order
-  **Current module** highlighted
-  **Lesson links** under each module
-  **Progress indicators** showing what you've completed

### Main Content Area

The center displays:

-  Lesson content with explanations
-  Code examples
-  Visual diagrams
-  Interactive components

### Next/Previous Buttons

At the bottom of each lesson:

-  **Previous** - Go back to review
-  **Next** - Continue to the next lesson

---

## Module Structure

Every module follows this pattern:

<Steps>
   <Step>
      #### Module Introduction An overview page (like Module 0's intro) explaining what you'll learn
   </Step>
   <Step>
      #### Individual Lessons Step-by-step lessons teaching specific concepts with code examples
   </Step>
   <Step>
      #### Module Completion A celebration page summarizing what you've accomplished
   </Step>
</Steps>

---

## Learning Objectives Display

At the start of each module, you'll see a task list like this:

<Files>
   <File name='‚úÖ Completed Task' />
   <File name='üìù Current Task' />
   <File name='‚è≥ Upcoming Task' />
</Files>

These help you track your progress and know what's coming next.

## Code Examples Format

Throughout the course, you'll encounter code snippets. Here's how to read them:

### Full File Examples

When we show a complete file, it looks like this:

```jsx title="src/App.jsx"
// src/App.jsx
import React from "react";

function App() {
   return (
      <div className='app'>
         <h1>Hello React!</h1>
      </div>
   );
}

export default App;
```

The comment at the top tells you the file path.

### Code Changes

When we modify existing code, we'll show the full context:

```jsx title="src/App.jsx"
// src/App.jsx
import React from "react";
import HomePage from "./pages/HomePage"; // ‚Üê NEW

function App() {
   return (
      <div className='app'>
         <HomePage /> {/* ‚Üê CHANGED */}
      </div>
   );
}

export default App;
```

Comments like `// ‚Üê NEW` or `{/* ‚Üê CHANGED */}` highlight what's different.

## Visual Indicators

Throughout the course, you'll see these helpful markers:

<Accordions type='single'>
   <Accordion id='tip' title='üí° Tips' value='tip'>
      Helpful hints and best practices to enhance your learning
   </Accordion>

   <Accordion id='warning' title='‚ö†Ô∏è Important' value='warning'>
      Critical information you shouldn't skip
   </Accordion>

   <Accordion id='note' title='üìù Note' value='note'>
      Additional context or explanations
   </Accordion>

   <Accordion id='checkpoint' title='‚úÖ Checkpoint' value='checkpoint'>
      Verification steps to confirm your code works
   </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Best Practices for Learning

To get the most out of this course:

1. **Follow Along** - Code alongside the lessons in your own project
2. **Don't Skip** - Each lesson builds on the previous ones
3. **Experiment** - Try modifying the code to see what happens
4. **Take Breaks** - Don't rush; understanding is more important than speed
5. **Ask Questions** - Use the community forum if you're stuck
