# Module 0 Validation

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Confirm your development environment is stable.
-  [ ] Ensure the TaskFlow Pro scaffold runs without warnings.
-  [ ] Audit documentation, notes, and follow-up tasks.
-  [ ] Set intentions for Module 1.

## Project Context

Quality gates keep the project healthy. Think of this as your pre-flight
checklist before building real features.

---

## Validation Categories

### Environment

-  Node.js, npm, and Git versions recorded.
-  `.env.local` configured and ignored by Git.
-  API mock (`npm run api`) starts successfully.

### Application

-  `npm run dev` renders the scaffold.
-  Linting and formatting scripts pass.
-  No TypeScript errors in VS Code.

### Documentation

-  `docs/` folder includes overview, dependencies, API, and UI component specs.
-  Notes contain wins, blockers, and follow-ups.

### Process

-  Workflow document captures branching and commit conventions.
-  Git history shows clear, scoped commits per lesson.

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Run a Dry Deployment

**Why:** Catch environment issues early by running `npm run build` now.

```bash
npm run build
```

### 2. Share a Summary

**Why:** Teaching reinforces learning. Explain what you set up to a friend or in
a study group.

```md
Module 0 Summary:

-  Tooling ready
-  Project scaffolded
-  Docs updated
```

---

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Skipping Build Command

**Problem:** Production builds fail later due to missing config.

```bash
# Bad: waiting until Module 8 to run npm run build.
```

**Solution:** Add build checks to validation.

### 2. Leaving TODOs Unowned

**Problem:** Follow-ups vanish when you start Module 1.

```md
// Bad: TODO without owner/date.
```

**Solution:** Assign yourself deadlines in notes or convert to issues.

## üî® Implement in TaskFlow Pro

### Task: Final Review

1. Run `npm run dev`, `npm run build`, and `npm run lint`.
2. Follow the validation categories above, ticking each item in
   `notes/m0-notes.md`.
3. Create `docs/status/m0.md` summarising outcomes and open questions for
   Module 1.
4. Commit with `git commit -am "chore: complete m0 validation"`.

#### Expected Result

You end Module 0 with confidence that your setup is reliable and future lessons
can focus on React fundamentals.

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

### Functionality

-  [ ] Dev server runs without warnings.
-  [ ] Production build succeeds.
-  [ ] Mock API returns data at `/api/projects`.

### Code Quality

-  [ ] ESLint and Prettier pass with no issues.
-  [ ] Documentation is updated and committed.

### Understanding

-  [ ] You can describe the project architecture and tooling.
-  [ ] You know which module introduces each major feature next.

### Project Integration

-  [ ] `notes/m0-notes.md` includes completed checklist.
-  [ ] `docs/status/m0.md` lists Module 1 prep tasks.
