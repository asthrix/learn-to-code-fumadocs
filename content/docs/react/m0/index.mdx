# Module 0 - Introduction

Welcome to **Project React**! üéâ

This introduction module will help you get oriented with the course platform,
understand what you'll be building, and prepare your development environment for
success.

## Overview

This is a **project-based React course** where you'll build a complete booking
application (similar to Airbnb) from scratch. Over the next 8 modules, you'll
progress from React fundamentals to deploying a production application.

No prior React experience needed - just solid JavaScript fundamentals!

## What You'll Build

By the end of this course, you'll have created a fully functional property
booking application featuring:

-  üè† **Property Listings Page** - Browse available rentals with search and
   filters
-  üîç **Property Details Page** - View detailed information, photos, and
   amenities
-  üìÖ **Booking System** - Select dates and number of guests
-  ‚ù§Ô∏è **Favorites** - Save properties you love (with Redux)
-  üîê **Authentication** - User registration and login
-  üåê **Multi-page Navigation** - Seamless routing between pages
