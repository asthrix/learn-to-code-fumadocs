Let's look at the booking application you'll build throughout this course.
You'll create a production-ready app with modern features and best practices.

## The Application

You'll build a **property booking platform** similar to Airbnb, where users can
browse, search, and book properties.

## Progressive Development

The course follows a logical progression:

```
Foundation
  ‚Üì
Static UI (Components, Props)
  ‚Üì
Interactivity (State, Events)
  ‚Üì
Data Fetching (Effects, API)
  ‚Üì
Multi-page App (Routing)
