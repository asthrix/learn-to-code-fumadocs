# Working with the Project

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Follow a branch-per-lesson workflow.
-  [ ] Write meaningful commit messages.
-  [ ] Run linting and formatting before pushing.
-  [ ] Track TODOs and follow-up items efficiently.

## Project Context

Efficient workflows keep TaskFlow Pro maintainable. Even as a solo learner,
acting like a team member builds professional habits.

---

## Git Workflow

1. Pull main: `git pull origin main`.
2. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/m0-lesson10-workflow`.
3. Develop with small commits per task.
4. Push branch: `git push -u origin feature/m0-lesson10-workflow`.

### Basic Example

```bash
git commit -m "feat: set up linting task"
```

### Practical Example

Create a `commitlint.config.cjs` (optional) or use conventional message format
to prepare for CI integration later.

---

## Task & Issue Tracking

Use the `notes/m0-notes.md` file created earlier:

-  Add a "Follow-up" section per lesson.
-  List bugs, questions, or improvements you want to revisit.

Consider opening GitHub issues for larger tasks when you reach Module 8.

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Run Checks Pre-Commit

**Why:** Avoids pushing broken code and saves review time.

```bash
npm run lint && npm run test -- --watch=false
```

### 2. Write Commit Messages in Imperative Mood

**Why:** Aligns with tooling and keeps history consistent.

```bash
git commit -m "docs: capture workflow tips"
```

---

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Large Commits

**Problem:** Hard to review or revert.

```bash
# Bad: mixing multiple lessons and fixes in one commit.
```

**Solution:** One commit per logical change; one PR per lesson if collaborating.

### 2. Ignoring TODOs

**Problem:** Lessons leave behind unresolved notes.

```md
// Bad: "TODO fix later" without tracking.
```

**Solution:** Add TODOs to notes with owners and due dates.

## üî® Implement in TaskFlow Pro

### Task: Document Your Workflow

1. Update `notes/workflow.md` with branch naming, commit style, and pre-commit
   checks.
2. Add a `pretest` script (placeholder for later) to `package.json` to remind
   yourself tests will arrive in Module 3.
3. Commit with `git commit -am "docs: define daily workflow"`.

#### Expected Result

You have a consistent way to start work, make changes, validate them, and
capture follow-ups.

---

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

### Functionality

-  [ ] Branch naming convention captured in notes.
-  [ ] `npm run lint` runs pre-commit.

### Code Quality

-  [ ] Commit messages follow the format `type: message`.
-  [ ] TODOs are tracked outside source files when possible.

### Understanding

-  [ ] You know when to create new branches vs continue on existing ones.
-  [ ] You can explain why small commits matter.

### Project Integration

-  [ ] `notes/workflow.md` references environment, dependencies, and API docs
       for quick cross-links.
-  [ ] Next lesson tasks (implementation) mention starting from a new branch.
