## Course Overview

React is the most popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. In
this comprehensive course, you'll learn how to build modern, scalable web
applications from the ground up.

### What You'll Learn

-  **React Fundamentals**: Components, JSX, and the virtual DOM
-  **State Management**: useState, useEffect, and advanced hooks
-  **Component Architecture**: Building reusable and maintainable components
-  **Routing**: Multi-page applications with React Router
-  **API Integration**: Fetching and managing data from external APIs
-  **Performance**: Optimization techniques and best practices
-  **Testing**: Unit testing with Jest and React Testing Library

### Prerequisites

Before starting this course, you should have:

-  Solid understanding of JavaScript (ES6+)
-  Basic knowledge of HTML and CSS
-  Familiarity with modern development tools (npm, Git)
-  Completed our [JavaScript Course](/docs/javascript) (recommended)

### Course Structure

This course is divided into 5 comprehensive modules:

1. **[React Fundamentals](/docs/react/module1)** - Components, JSX, and Props
2. **[State and Events](/docs/react/module2)** - Interactive components and
   state management
3. **[Advanced Hooks](/docs/react/module3)** - useEffect, custom hooks, and
   context
4. **[Routing and Navigation](/docs/react/module4)** - Multi-page applications
5. **[Final Project](/docs/react/module5)** - Build a complete task management
   app

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

-  Build complex, interactive user interfaces with React
-  Manage application state effectively using hooks and context
-  Create reusable components with proper prop handling
-  Implement client-side routing for single-page applications
-  Integrate with REST APIs and handle asynchronous operations
-  Apply React best practices and performance optimizations
-  Test React components and applications
-  Deploy React applications to production

### Final Project: Task Manager App

Throughout the course, you'll build a fully-functional task management
application featuring:

-  **User Authentication**: Login and registration system
-  **Task Management**: Create, edit, delete, and organize tasks
-  **Categories**: Organize tasks by custom categories
-  **Filtering & Search**: Find tasks quickly with advanced filtering
