## Workflow Snapshot

1. **Learn** a focused concept in plain language.
2. **See** the idea in a minimal example and a TaskFlow Pro snippet.
3. **Build** the corresponding feature in the project repository.
4. **Validate** using the checklist before advancing.

We front-load environment setup in M0, build core UI in M1, then layer
interactivity, data, and advanced architecture.

         <strong>Project-first:</strong> Every example ties back to TaskFlow Pro
         so learners never wonder “when will I use this?”.

         <strong>Proof over promise:</strong> Each module ends with a validation
         checklist you can run to prove readiness for the next stage.
      </p>
      <p>
         <strong>Inclusive pacing:</strong> Lessons remain short, but optional
         collapsible sections (like this one) provide enrichment for curious
         learners.

## Next Steps

1. Skim the Module 0 overview to understand the setup journey.
2. Block out two 45-minute sessions to complete the first three lessons.
3. Keep the [React docs](https://react.dev) and
   [Fumadocs UI kit](https://fumadocs.dev/docs/ui/components) handy for
   reference.

You are six modules away from a production build—let’s get started.
