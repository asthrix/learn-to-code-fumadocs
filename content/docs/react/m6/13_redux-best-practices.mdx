# Redux Best Practices

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Define conventions for slices, selectors, and thunks.
-  [ ] Instrument Redux with middleware for analytics and errors.
-  [ ] Monitor selector performance and memoisation.
-  [ ] Document governance rules for contributors.

## Structural Guidelines

-  One domain per slice (projects, tasks, preferences).
-  Co-locate thunks with slices or dedicated `thunks/` folder.
-  Export actions and selectors from slice entry points.

### File Layout

```
src/state/
├── store.ts
├── projects/
│   ├── slice.ts
│   ├── selectors.ts
│   └── thunks.ts
└── tasks/
    ├── slice.ts
    ├── selectors.ts
    └── thunks.ts
```

---

## Middleware & DevTools

-  Use Redux DevTools in development only.
-  Add logging middleware for debugging, but gate behind env flags.
-  Emit analytics events (route, filters) from thunks.

```tsx
const store = configureStore({
   reducer,
   middleware: (getDefaultMiddleware) =>
      getDefaultMiddleware({
         thunk: { extraArgument: { api, analytics } },
      }).concat(trackErrorsMiddleware),
   devTools: process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production",
});
```

## Governance Checklist

-  Require selectors for all shared state reads.
-  Memoise expensive selectors and measure with performance tooling.
-  Add tests for reducers + thunks before merging complex features.

      ## Governance
      - Naming: `domainSlice`, `selectDomainById`
      - Middleware: analytics + error tracking registered in `store.ts`
      - Testing: reducers + selectors require unit tests, thunks require integration tests
      ```

   </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## ✅ Validation Checklist

-  [ ] Slices follow agreed naming and layout.
-  [ ] Middleware stack documented and unit tested.
-  [ ] DevTools disabled in production builds.
