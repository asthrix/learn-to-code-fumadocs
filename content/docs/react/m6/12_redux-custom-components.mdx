# Redux Custom Components

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Pair Redux selectors with container components.
-  [ ] Create reusable hooks that encapsulate dispatch logic.
-  [ ] Keep presentational components unaware of Redux internals.
-  [ ] Document shared patterns for future features.

## Container + Presentational Pattern

```tsx
function TaskSummaryContainer({ projectId }: { projectId: string }) {
   const project = useAppSelector((state) =>
      selectProjectById(state, projectId)
   );
   const counts = useAppSelector((state) =>
      selectTaskCountsByProject(state, projectId)
   );
   const dispatch = useAppDispatch();

   const onRefresh = useCallback(() => {
      dispatch(syncProjectTasks(projectId));
   }, [dispatch, projectId]);

   if (!project) return null;
   return (
      <TaskSummaryView
         project={project}
         counts={counts}
         onRefresh={onRefresh}
      />
   );
}
```

-  Presentational view receives stable props (`project`, `counts`, `onRefresh`).
-  Container handles Redux specifics (selectors, dispatch, thunks).

---

## Custom Hooks for Redux

```tsx
export function useActiveProjectTasks() {
   const activeProjectId = useAppSelector(selectActiveProjectId);
   const tasks = useAppSelector((state) =>
      selectTasksByProject(state, activeProjectId)
   );
   return { activeProjectId, tasks };
}
```

-  Shareable across components without duplicating selector logic.
-  Compose with existing hooks (e.g. performance module controllers).

## Pattern Library Entry

Document patterns so new contributors follow the same architecture.

<Accordions type='single' className='mt-4'>
   <Accordion title='Pattern Documentation'>
      <p>Record container/view conventions alongside performance docs.</p>

      ```md filename="docs/state-architecture.md"
      # Redux Component Patterns
      - Container components use hooks + dispatch; views remain stateless
      - Custom hooks expose common selector combinations
      - Controllers feed views with memoised props to support `React.memo`
      ```

   </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## ✅ Validation Checklist

-  [ ] Containers encapsulate all Redux knowledge.
-  [ ] Views accept serialization-friendly props.
-  [ ] Hooks reuse selectors instead of duplicating queries.
