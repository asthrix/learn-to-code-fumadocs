# Implementing Module 6

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Replace prop-drilled state with shared selectors and hooks.
-  [ ] Sync TaskFlow Pro data via Redux Toolkit thunks.
-  [ ] Compose Zustand stores for preferences and UI-specific state.
-  [ ] Update documentation describing the new global state model.

## Implementation Plan

1. Create `AppProviders` that layer `PreferencesProvider`, Zustand stores, and
   the Redux provider.
2. Configure Redux store with project/task slices and typed hooks.
3. Migrate dashboard + project detail routes to consume selectors and Zustand
   hooks.
4. Add async thunks for fetching/creating tasks while keeping optimistic
   updates.
5. Persist preference state with Zustand middleware for seamless UX.
6. Update documentation (`docs/state-architecture.md`,
   `notes/module-6-state-plan.md`).

## Migration Tips

-  Move one route at a time (Dashboard → Project Detail → Settings) and verify
   both stores.
-  Keep local UI state (modal open) local; elevate only shared concerns.
-  Use feature flags if collaborating with other teams to control rollouts.

      ## Implementation Tasks
      - [ ] Providers composed in `src/app/providers.tsx`
      - [ ] Dashboard uses Redux selectors + Zustand preferences store
      - [ ] Project detail page dispatches `syncProjectTasks`
      - [ ] Settings panel reads `usePreferencesStore`
      - [ ] Docs updated: `docs/state-architecture.md`
      ```

      ```bash
      git add src/state src/context docs/state-architecture.md notes/module-6-state-plan.md
      git commit -m "feat: implement module 6 global state"
      ```

## ✅ Validation Checklist

-  [ ] All major routes use shared state stores (Zustand + Redux) appropriately.
-  [ ] Async thunks succeed and roll back gracefully on failure.
-  [ ] Preference state persists across reloads via Zustand middleware.
-  [ ] Documentation reflects the final architecture.
