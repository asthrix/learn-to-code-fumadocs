- ✅ Large community and ecosystem
- ✅ Proven patterns for large-scale applications
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation and learning resources

**Great for:** Enterprise applications, team projects, complex state logic

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Redux Toolkit Benefits">

Redux Toolkit modernizes Redux with:

```js
// Old Redux (verbose)
const INCREMENT = 'counter/increment';
const increment = () => ({ type: INCREMENT });
const counterReducer = (state = 0, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case INCREMENT:
      return state + 1;
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

// Redux Toolkit (simple!)
const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'counter',
  initialState: 0,
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => state + 1
  }
});
```

**70% less boilerplate!** ✨

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Powerful DevTools">

Redux DevTools provide **incredible debugging capabilities**:
