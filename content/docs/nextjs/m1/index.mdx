## 🏗️ What You'll Build

In this module, you'll create the core UI components for **TaskFlow Pro**:

### Components You'll Create:

-  🎯 **Header Component** - Navigation and branding
-  📋 **TaskCard Component** - Display individual tasks with priorities
-  🔧 **Sidebar Component** - Navigation and filters
-  🎨 **Beautiful styling** with Tailwind CSS
-  📱 **Responsive design** that works on all devices

<div className='bg-blue-50 border border-blue-200 rounded-lg p-6 my-6'>
   <h4 className='font-bold text-blue-900 mb-2'>💡 Learning Approach</h4>
   <p className='text-blue-800'>
      Each component will be built incrementally, starting with basic structure
      and gradually adding features, styling, and interactivity. You'll see both
      the "before" and "after" for every change.
