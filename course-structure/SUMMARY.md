## 🚀 Next Steps

### Priority 1: Complete M0 (THIS WEEK)

Create 7 remaining lessons:

1. `project-overview.mdx` - TaskFlow Pro architecture
2. `dependencies.mdx` - npm packages and tools
3. `linting.mdx` - ESLint and Prettier setup
4. `environment.mdx` - .env files and configuration
5. `running.mdx` - Development server and scripts
6. `implementation.mdx` - Build the project shell
7. `validation.mdx` - Environment verification

**Time Estimate:** 5-6 hours **Use:** Template from
`CONTENT_GENERATION_GUIDE.md`

### Priority 2: Complete M1 (NEXT WEEK)

Create 11 lessons on React fundamentals:

-  Introduction to React
-  JSX and rendering
-  Components and props
-  Lifecycle and hooks intro
-  Styling with Tailwind
-  Implementation and validation

**Time Estimate:** 8-10 hours **Result:** Students will have Header, Sidebar,
and TaskCard components

### Priority 3: Create M2-M4 (WEEKS 3-4)

Core React concepts:

-  M2: State and event handlers (interactive tasks)
-  M3: Effects and data fetching (API integration)
-  M4: Routes and navigation (multi-page app)

**Time Estimate:** 20-25 hours **Result:** Functional TaskFlow Pro with CRUD
operations and navigation

## 💡 Course Philosophy

### Project-Based Learning

Every lesson builds TaskFlow Pro. Students create a real, deployable
application - not toy examples.

### Progressive Complexity

```
M0: Environment → M1: Components → M2: Interactivity →
M3: Data → M4: Navigation → M5: Performance →
M6: State → M7: Auth → M8: Deploy → MX: Advanced
```

### Production Quality

Teach industry best practices from day one. Show what professional React code
looks like.

### Practical Focus

Answer "why" before "how". Connect every concept to real-world scenarios and job
requirements.
