# Running the Project

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Start the Vite dev server and open TaskFlow Pro in the browser.
-  [ ] Verify hot module replacement (HMR) works for quick feedback.
-  [ ] Configure a VS Code task or npm script alias for speed.
-  [ ] Log common errors and fixes for future reference.

## Project Context

You will run the dev server dozens of times per module. Learn the lifecycle
now‚Äîstart API, start Vite, refresh on changes‚Äîso future lessons focus purely on
features.

---

## Start the Dev Server

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the printed URL (typically `http://localhost:5173`).

### Basic Example

```bash
VITE v5.0.0  ready in 123 ms
‚ûú  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
```

### Practical Example

Add an npm script to run API + web concurrently (optional for later modules):

```json
{
   "scripts": {
      "dev": "vite",
      "dev:full": "concurrently \"npm run api\" \"npm run dev\""
   }
}
```

Install `concurrently` with `npm install -D concurrently` if you enable
`dev:full`.

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Use Terminal Split View

**Why:** Keep API logs and Vite logs visible together.

```bash
# VS Code shortcut
Ctrl+`
# Split terminal
Ctrl+Shift+5 (Windows) / Cmd+Shift+5 (macOS)
```

### 2. Capture Error Fixes

**Why:** When Vite fails to compile, note solutions for teammates.

```md
-  "Port already in use" ‚Üí run `lsof -i :5173` and kill the process.
```

---

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Forgetting to Start the API

**Problem:** Pages relying on data show errors.

```md
// Bad: launching only Vite and wondering why fetches fail.
```

**Solution:** Start API (`npm run api`) before or alongside `npm run dev`.

### 2. Leaving Servers Running

**Problem:** Extra background processes hog ports or CPU.

```bash
# Bad: multiple Vite instances running after closing the tab.
```

**Solution:** Stop servers with `Ctrl+C` (twice on Windows) when done.

## üî® Implement in TaskFlow Pro

### Task: Create a VS Code Task (optional but helpful)

1. Add `.vscode/tasks.json` with a task that runs `npm run dev`.
2. Bind it to a shortcut or set `"npm run dev"` as the default build task
   (Terminal ‚Üí Configure Default Build Task).
3. Document the command in `notes/workflow.md`.

#### Expected Result

Launching the dev server becomes a two-click or shortcut action, making frequent
restarts painless.

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

### Functionality

-  [ ] `npm run dev` starts and displays the Vite dashboard.
-  [ ] Browser automatically refreshes after editing `src/App.tsx`.

### Code Quality

-  [ ] `.vscode/tasks.json` is committed for team reuse.
-  [ ] Terminal output is recorded in your notes (screenshots or copy/paste).

### Understanding

-  [ ] You can explain the difference between `npm run dev` and `npm run build`.
-  [ ] You know how to stop the server cleanly on your OS.

### Project Integration

-  [ ] Workflow notes include troubleshooting tips for startup errors.
-  [ ] `package.json` scripts remain tidy and documented.
