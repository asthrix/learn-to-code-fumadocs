# Dependencies

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Identify core, dev, and optional dependencies.
-  [ ] Understand how each package supports TaskFlow Pro.
-  [ ] Record version pins and upgrade cadence.
-  [ ] Map dependencies to modules where they are introduced.

## Project Context

Knowing your stack helps troubleshoot build issues and evaluate future upgrades.
Capture the dependency rationale now to avoid guesswork later.

## Core Dependencies

| Package                 | Purpose                    | Introduced        |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `react` & `react-dom`   | UI rendering               | M1                |
| `react-router-dom`      | Routing                    | M4                |
| `@tanstack/react-query` | Data fetching enhancements | M3 (optional), MX |
| `axios`                 | HTTP client                | M3                |
| `tailwindcss`           | Styling                    | M1                |
| `zod`                   | Runtime validation         | M7                |

### Basic Example

```bash
npm install react react-dom react-router-dom axios
```

### Practical Example

```bash
npm install -D typescript @types/node @types/react autoprefixer postcss tailwindcss eslint prettier
```

Install dev dependencies together after bootstrapping Vite.

---

## Version Strategy

Pin to major versions that align with the course timeline. Document upgrade
windows in the project repo.

```json
{
   "dependencies": {
      "react": "^18.3.1",
      "react-router-dom": "^6.27.0",
      "axios": "^1.7.7"
   }
}
```

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Track Install Commands in Docs

**Why:** Reproducibility is key when onboarding teammates.

```md
npm install react react-dom npm install -D eslint prettier
```

### 2. Separate Runtime vs Dev Dependencies

**Why:** Keeps bundle size predictable and audit trails clean.

```bash
npm install package-name           # runtime
npm install -D package-name        # development
```

---

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Installing Unused Packages

**Problem:** Bloated dependencies slow installs and enlarge bundles.

```bash
# Bad: grabbing libraries "just in case".
npm install lodash moment
```

**Solution:**

Install only when a lesson requires it and record the why.

### 2. Ignoring Security Advisories

**Problem:** Vulnerabilities accumulate silently.

```bash
# Bad: never running npm audit.
```

**Solution:**

```bash
npm audit --production
```

Review reports after major installs.

## üî® Implement in TaskFlow Pro

### Task: Draft `dependencies.md`

1. Create `docs/dependencies.md`.
2. Add tables for runtime, dev, and optional packages with purpose + module.
3. Record commands to install each group.
4. Commit with `git commit -am "docs: document dependencies"`.

#### Expected Result

You have a single source of truth for required packages and upgrade cadence.

---

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

### Functionality

-  [ ] `docs/dependencies.md` lists runtime and dev dependencies separately.
-  [ ] Install commands reproduce the configuration from scratch.

### Code Quality

-  [ ] Version ranges use caret (`^`) for minor updates unless fixed.
-  [ ] Doc explains why optional libraries are optional.

### Understanding

-  [ ] You can match each dependency to the module that introduces it.
-  [ ] You know which packages run only during development.

### Project Integration

-  [ ] Notes link to the dependencies doc.
-  [ ] Pending upgrades are logged as TODOs or GitHub issues.
