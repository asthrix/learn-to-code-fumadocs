# Module 3 Validation

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Run through an end-to-end validation checklist for the data layer.
-  [ ] Confirm effects clean up properly and avoid duplicate requests.
-  [ ] Verify optimistic updates, caching, and retries work as expected.
-  [ ] Record follow-up tasks for routing and performance modules.

## Project Context

Validation consolidates Module 3 work. Treat this as a mini QA pass to ensure
TaskFlow Pro behaves reliably before layering on routing in Module 4.

---

## Manual Test Plan

1. **Initial load:** Ensure tasks appear with a brief skeleton state.
2. **Empty state:** Clear tasks via the API or toggle filters to confirm the
   empty callout.
3. **Error path:** Force the API to return `500` (modify mock) and confirm error
   messaging + logging.
4. **Optimistic create/update/delete:** Verify UI updates immediately and rolls
   back on forced failures.
5. **Caching:** Navigate between filters; data should show instantly if cached
   within 30 seconds.
6. **Retry:** Simulate flaky network (offline devtools) and confirm retries
   before failure.

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

### Functionality

-  [ ] Initial load shows skeletons, then renders task list.
-  [ ] Empty state callout appears when no tasks match filters.
-  [ ] Error callout displays friendly message with retry guidance.
-  [ ] Optimistic updates reflect immediately for create/update/delete.
-  [ ] Optimistic rollbacks restore prior data on failure.
-  [ ] Cache returns results instantly when revisiting recent filters.
-  [ ] Retry helper attempts operations before surfacing failure.
-  [ ] Scroll position resets when filters change.

### Code Quality

-  [ ] `useTasksState` effects include complete dependency arrays.
-  [ ] Abort controllers clean up in every effect.
-  [ ] Cache helpers live in `src/lib/api/cache.ts` with TTL constants.
-  [ ] Logs use consistent labels (`[tasks.fetch]`, `[tasks.create]`, etc.).
-  [ ] Notes and checklist files updated with latest findings.

### Understanding

-  [ ] You can explain how caching, optimistic updates, and retries interact.
-  [ ] You can diagram the effect lifecycle for fetch + mutations.
-  [ ] You can justify TTL and retry count based on product needs.

### Project Integration

-  [ ] `notes/module-3-effects-plan.md` reflects final behavior.
-  [ ] `docs/data-fetching-checklist.md` includes any new learnings.
-  [ ] Follow-up tasks for Module 4 (routing) recorded in notes.

## üî® Implement in TaskFlow Pro

Capture validation outcomes for future reference:

1. Update `notes/module-3-effects-plan.md` with a "Validation" section
   summarizing test results and outstanding risks.
2. Add any TODOs uncovered to `docs/data-fetching-checklist.md`.
3. Commit with `git commit -am "docs: record module 3 validation"`.

<Accordions type='single' className='mt-4'>
   <Accordion title='Solution Walkthrough'>
      <p>
         Keep validation artifacts close to the plan so the team can reference them when extending the data layer.
      </p>

      ## Validation Summary
      - Initial load: ‚úÖ
      - Empty state: ‚úÖ
      - Error handling: ‚úÖ (shows callout, logs details)
      - Optimistic updates: ‚úÖ (rolled back on forced failure)
      - Caching: ‚úÖ (returns results within 30s window)
      - Retry: ‚ö†Ô∏è Monitor latency when network recovers slowly
      ```

      ```bash
      git add notes/module-3-effects-plan.md docs/data-fetching-checklist.md
      git commit -m "docs: record module 3 validation"
      ```

   </Accordion>
</Accordions>

#### Expected Result

Module 3 is validated, documented, and ready for Module 4's routing work.
