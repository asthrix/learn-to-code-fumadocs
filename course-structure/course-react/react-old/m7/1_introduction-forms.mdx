# Introduction to Forms

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

-  [ ] Document the sign-up, login, and reset flows TaskFlow Pro needs.
-  [ ] Align on validation and error copy requirements.
-  [ ] Set measurable goals for conversion and drop-off.
-  [ ] Coordinate timelines with backend/auth providers.

## Project Context

TaskFlow Pro now supports global state and shared data. Module 7 focuses on
collecting user credentials safely and guiding people through onboarding. This
lesson frames the scope so each subsequent exercise ties back to a tangible
deliverable.
