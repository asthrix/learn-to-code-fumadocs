# Project Brief & Requirements

StaySense needs a polished MVP before you can share it confidently. This lesson
pulls requirements from the comprehensive documentation and scopes them to a
four-lesson sprint.

---

## MVP Goals

1. **Browse**: Discover listings with filters and saved stays.
2. **Inspect**: Open a detail page with gallery, description, and amenities.
3. **Trust**: Experience smooth loading states and accessible navigation.
4. **Support**: Understand how to run and extend the project (README + docs).

| Area          | Requirement                                               |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Routing       | Client-side navigation between Home, Saved, Detail        |
| Detail page   | Carousel/gallery, long description, key facts, CTA        |
| Saved view    | Filters existing saved stays, persists across sessions    |
| Accessibility | Keyboard navigation, focus outlines, descriptive alt text |
| Meta          | Social preview image, meaningful page titles              |
| Documentation | Updated README with setup, scripts, architecture overview |

   columns.
