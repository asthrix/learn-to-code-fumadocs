# Module 2 · State & Interaction

Module 2 transforms StaySense from a static brochure into an interactive
product. You'll implement booking filters, manage saved stays, and practice the
React patterns that underpin more advanced architecture.

---

## What You Will Build

-  A filter bar that updates listing results in real time.
-  A "Save for later" button powered by React state.
-  Conditional empty states when filters yield no matches.
-  A session persistence strategy using `localStorage` (optional stretch).

---

## Lesson Roadmap

1. **Lesson 1 – State basics**: learn `useState`, state immutability, and state
   lifting.
2. **Lesson 2 – Event handling**: wire filter controls and actions.
3. **Lesson 3 – Lists & conditions**: render filtered results with approachable
   fallbacks.
4. **Lesson 4 – Controlled forms**: build the filter bar with controlled inputs
   and derived state.
5. **Lesson 5 – Module task**: ship the full filter experience with saved stays.

---

## Success Criteria

-  Filter controls update listings without page refresh.
-  Saved stays persist in session (memory or optional `localStorage`).
-  Empty state messaging guides users when no listings match.
-  Code remains readable with descriptive state names and helper functions.

      <p>
         The optional persistence stretch mirrors the mock API's reliance on
         `localStorage`. Completing it now makes Module 3's effect hooks easier
         to reason about.
