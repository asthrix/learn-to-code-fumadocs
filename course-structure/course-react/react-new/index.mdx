# StaySense React Launchpad

StaySense is a pared-down take on a vacation rental marketplace. Across four
modules you will spin up a modern React workspace, craft reusable UI, wire in
stateful interactions, and finally connect to the mock API described in the
Project React architecture docs.

## Course at a Glance

| Module | Focus                         | StaySense Milestone                |
| ------ | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| M1     | React foundations + layout    | Vite app with hero + listing shell |
| M2     | State & interactivity         | Dynamic filters and saved picks    |
| M3     | Effects & data flow           | Live listings from the mock API    |
| M4     | Project assembly & deployment | Polished MVP + walkthrough recap   |

Each lesson keeps to a single concept, a practical example, and a concrete task
that moves the StaySense codebase forward. Expect 20–30 minute sessions designed
for evening study or team lunch-and-learns.

## Workflow Snapshot

1. **Read**: absorb the concept in plain language with relevant visuals.
2. **Inspect**: review the miniature StaySense snippet that applies the idea.
3. **Ship**: complete the scoped task in your repository, validating with the
   lesson checklist.
4. **Reflect**: compare against the accordion solution to confirm understanding.

The path mirrors the technical documentation in `/course-docs`, translating the
broader architecture into approachable beginner steps.

## Course Commitments

-  **Time:** Roughly seven hours per module including project work.
-  **Tech:** Node.js LTS, npm, VS Code, Git, a modern Chromium-based browser.
-  **Mindset:** Practice in small increments, keep commits scoped, lean on the
   provided mock backend instead of building one from scratch.

         The Launchpad course covers the same StaySense domain as Project React
         but focuses on the essentials: component thinking, state, effects, and
         basic API integration. The advanced topics (Redux Toolkit, auth flows,
         deployment hardening) remain in the flagship track.

         Because you use the shared mock API, graduating Launchpad means you can
         jump into Module 3 of the main curriculum without missing critical
         context.

## Next Steps

1. Skim the Module 1 overview to note the tooling prerequisites.
2. Clone the starter repository or initialise a fresh Vite app as instructed in
   lesson one.
3. Schedule two study blocks this week; every module includes a milestone task
   with a guided solution.

You're four modules away from shipping your first listing marketplace MVP. Let's
build it together.
