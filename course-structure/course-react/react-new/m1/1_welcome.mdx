# Why React for StaySense

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson you will:

-  [ ] Summarise the StaySense product vision in two sentences.
-  [ ] Explain React's declarative UI model to a peer.
-  [ ] Identify at least three course milestones and why they matter.

## StaySense at a Glance

StaySense is a vacation rental discovery app inspired by the comprehensive
Project React curriculum. Where the full program spans nine modules, Launchpad
focuses on the core flow: browse listings, filter by needs, and view rich detail
pages backed by a mock API.

Key characteristics pulled from
`/course-docs/COMPREHENSIVE_COURSE_PLATFORM_DOCUMENTATION.md`:

-  **Project-first**: You will ship meaningful UI in every module.
-  **Mock backend**: Axios interceptors + `localStorage` simulate a real
   service.
-  **Stepwise complexity**: Concepts build from components → state → data → app.

## Why React?

React is a declarative library for building interactive user interfaces. Instead
of manually updating the DOM, you describe the desired UI for a given state and
let React handle the reconciliation.

```tsx
function ListingCount({ total }: { total: number }) {
   return (
      <p className='text-sm text-muted-foreground'>
         Showing <span className='font-semibold'>{total}</span> stays
      </p>
   );
}
```

In the snippet above, React ensures the `<p>` element updates whenever `total`
changes—no DOM selectors required.

## StaySense Milestones

Each module delivers a tangible piece of the StaySense experience:

-  **Module 1**: Landing page scaffold (hero, listing card, navigation).
-  **Module 2**: Filters and saved stays using `useState` and props.
-  **Module 3**: Remote data via the mock API + loading states.
-  **Module 4**: Completing the MVP with detail page and deployment checklist.

These pieces mirror the "Core System Components" in the documentation, giving
you continuity if you choose to continue with the flagship course.

## Task · Capture Your Learning Goals

Create a short learning manifesto so you can measure progress later.

1. Open or create `notes/launchpad-goals.md` in your repository.
2. Write one paragraph summarising why you want to learn React now.
3. List three measurable goals (e.g., "Build a reusable card component without
   copying docs").
4. Commit with `git commit -am "docs: add launchpad goals"`.

<Accordions type='single' className='mt-4'>
   <Accordion title='Solution Inspiration'>
      <p>
         Here's an example manifesto. Personalise it so it reflects your WHY and
         keeps you accountable.
      </p>

      ```md
      # StaySense Launchpad Goals

      I am learning React so I can prototype product ideas quickly and ship UI that feels modern. The StaySense project gives me a realistic playground without backend overhead.

      ## Goals
      - Build the StaySense landing page from scratch by the end of Module 1.
      - Explain the difference between props and state without notes.
      - Demo a filtered listings view to a colleague in under 5 minutes.
      ```

      <p className='mt-3'>
         Stage and commit once your manifesto is in place:
      </p>

      ```bash
      git add notes/launchpad-goals.md
      git commit -m "docs: add launchpad goals"
      ```

   </Accordion>
</Accordions>
