# Environment Setup with Vite

StaySense uses the same tooling stack documented in
`/course-docs/TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`: Vite for lightning-fast
bundling, Tailwind for styling primitives, and ESLint/Prettier for consistency.
Let's scaffold the project.

---

## 1. Create the Project

Run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
npm create vite@latest staysense -- --template react-ts
cd staysense
npm install
```

This generates a React + TypeScript project with Vite's sensible defaults.

---

## 2. Install Course Dependencies

Borrowing from the technical guide's Phase 1 and Phase 3, install the UI
packages used throughout the curriculum:

```bash
npm install axios axios-mock-adapter date-fns js-cookie jose
npm install class-variance-authority clsx tailwind-merge
npm install @radix-ui/react-avatar @radix-ui/react-checkbox @radix-ui/react-dialog \
  @radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu @radix-ui/react-progress @radix-ui/react-select \
  @radix-ui/react-separator @radix-ui/react-slot lucide-react
```

These dependencies unlock the components mirrored in the documentation (e.g.,
buttons, dropdowns, progress bars) and prepare you for later modules.

---

## 3. Configure Tailwind (Optional but Recommended)

If you prefer Tailwind to plain CSS, initialise it as described in Phase 1:

```bash
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

Update `tailwind.config.js` to enable class-based dark mode and animations.
Alternatively, keep Vite's default `src/index.css` and rely on utility classes
from the Fumadocs components.

---

## 4. Run the Dev Server

```bash
npm run dev -- --open
```

Your browser should open `http://localhost:5173/` with the Vite welcome screen.
We will replace this UI in Lesson 3.

---

## Task · Snapshot the Setup

Document your environment to reduce onboarding time on future machines.

1. Create `docs/environment.md` in the project root.
2. Note your Node.js version (`node -v`), editor, and installed extensions.
3. List the npm commands you ran and any custom configuration performed.
4. Commit with `git commit -am "docs: record environment setup"`.
