# Module 1 · React Foundations

Module 1 eases you into React while assembling the StaySense landing page. You
will create the app shell, hero section, and first reusable listing card. Every
lesson ends with a hands-on task and an accordion solution so you can compare
approaches without losing momentum.

---

## Prerequisites

-  Node.js 18+ and npm available on your terminal path.
-  VS Code with ESLint and Prettier extensions (recommended but optional).
-  Familiarity with modern JavaScript syntax (ES modules, `const`/`let`, arrow
   functions).
-  Optional: skim the mock API section in
   `/course-docs/API_AND_DATA_ARCHITECTURE.md` to understand where you are
   heading.

---

## What You Will Build

By the end of Module 1 you will have:

-  A Vite-powered React project named **StaySense**.
-  Global styles using Tailwind CSS or the existing `global.css` utilities.
-  A responsive hero with call-to-action buttons.
-  A `ListingCard` component rendering mock data from `src/data/listings.ts`.

These pieces establish the layout that later modules enhance with filters,
stateful interactions, and API data.

---

## Lesson Roadmap

1. **Lesson 1 – Why React & the StaySense vision**: understand the problem
   you're solving and how React's design helps.
2. **Lesson 2 – Environment setup with Vite**: scaffold the project, install UI
   dependencies, and run the dev server.
3. **Lesson 3 – JSX and your first components**: write semantic markup and map
   over sample data.
4. **Lesson 4 – Props & composition**: pass data into components and compose the
   page.
5. **Lesson 5 – Module task**: pull everything together with a structured
   commit.

---

## Success Criteria

To exit Module 1 you should confidently:

-  Explain the purpose of React, components, and JSX to a teammate.
-  Run `npm run dev` and see a customised StaySense landing page.
-  Build presentational components that accept props and render predictable UI.
-  Commit code following the "build, test, validate" loop used throughout the
   course.

         Each lesson includes a validation checklist. Before moving to Module 2,
         run through the Module 1 checklist in Lesson 5. If any item feels
         shaky, revisit the matching lesson and re-ship the task.
