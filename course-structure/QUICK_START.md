# Quick Start: Generate React Course Content

## üéØ Goal

Create production-ready, project-based React course content following
established templates and standards.

---

## ‚ö° Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### 1. Open These Files in Tabs:

```
‚úÖ Template: course-structure/CONTENT_GENERATION_GUIDE.md
‚úÖ Topics: course-structure/react/tocpis.md
‚úÖ Example: content/docs/react/m0/welcome.mdx
‚úÖ Status: course-structure/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md
```

### 2. Create Your Next Lesson:

```bash
# Navigate to React content
cd content/docs/react/m0/

# Create new lesson file
touch project-overview.mdx
```

### 3. Copy Template Structure:

From `CONTENT_GENERATION_GUIDE.md`, copy the lesson template

### 4. Fill in Content:

-  Update frontmatter (title, lesson number, etc.)
-  Write learning objectives
-  Add project context
-  Write concept explanations
-  Add code examples
-  Write best practices (2-3)
-  Write common mistakes (2-3)
-  Create implementation guide
-  Build validation checklist

### 5. Test:

```bash
# Start dev server (if not running)
npm run dev

# Visit in browser
http://localhost:3000/docs/react/m0/project-overview

# Check navigation works
```

## üìã Lesson Creation Checklist

For each lesson:

### Before Writing:

-  [ ] Read the topic outline in `tocpis.md`
-  [ ] Review similar lesson examples
-  [ ] Understand TaskFlow Pro integration
-  [ ] Know previous and next lessons

### While Writing:

-  [ ] Use template structure exactly
-  [ ] Keep beginner-friendly tone
-  [ ] Test all code examples
-  [ ] Connect to real-world scenarios
-  [ ] Show good AND bad examples

### After Writing:

-  [ ] Verify frontmatter is complete
-  [ ] Check all sections are present
-  [ ] Test code examples actually run
-  [ ] Verify navigation links work
-  [ ] Review against quality checklist
-  [ ] Proofread for typos and clarity

## üéì Module Priority Order

Create in this order for best learning flow:

1. **M0 Remaining** (7 lessons) - HIGH PRIORITY

   -  Students need complete setup first
   -  Establishes project foundation

2. **M1 Complete** (11 lessons) - HIGH PRIORITY

   -  Core React concepts
   -  First TaskFlow Pro components

3. **M2 Complete** (12 lessons) - MEDIUM PRIORITY

   -  Makes app interactive
   -  Critical for engagement

4. **M3-M4** (22 lessons) - MEDIUM PRIORITY

   -  Data and navigation
   -  App becomes functional

5. **M5-M7** (35 lessons) - LOWER PRIORITY

   -  Advanced concepts
   -  Polish and features

6. **M8, MX** (15 lessons) - LOWEST PRIORITY
   -  Deployment and extras
   -  Important but can wait

## üéØ TaskFlow Pro Feature Progression

Track what gets built in each module:

```
M0: Project shell + environment
M1: Header, Sidebar, TaskCard components
M2: Task CRUD (create, read, update, delete)
M3: API integration + data persistence
M4: Dashboard, Projects, Settings pages
M5: Performance optimization + custom hooks
M6: Global state (user preferences, theme)
M7: User login + authentication
M8: Production deployment
MX: Drag-and-drop + advanced features
```

Each lesson should advance TaskFlow Pro!

## üí° Writing Tips

### Do:

‚úÖ Use analogies for complex concepts ‚úÖ Show code examples early and often ‚úÖ
Explain WHY before HOW ‚úÖ Reference real companies (Facebook, Netflix) ‚úÖ
Encourage hands-on practice ‚úÖ Connect to job market value ‚úÖ Use conversational
tone ‚úÖ Validate understanding frequently

### Don't:

‚ùå Assume prior knowledge ‚ùå Use jargon without explanation ‚ùå Create toy
examples (use TaskFlow Pro!) ‚ùå Skip the "why" behind concepts ‚ùå Forget
validation checklists ‚ùå Leave code examples untested ‚ùå Rush through best
practices

---

## üîß Common Patterns

### Code Example Pattern:

```
1. Simple example (isolated concept)
2. Realistic example (TaskFlow Pro context)
3. Advanced example (production pattern)
```

### Best Practice Pattern:

```
1. Practice name
2. Why it matters
3. Good code example
4. Explanation
```

### Common Mistake Pattern:

```
1. Mistake name
2. Problem explanation
3. Bad code showing the issue
4. Solution with corrected code
```
