## 🎓 Key Principles to Follow

### 1. Project-Based Learning

Every lesson connects to TaskFlow Pro. Students build a real application, not
toy examples.

### 2. Progressive Complexity

Start simple, build complexity gradually. Each module builds on previous work.

### 3. Production Quality

Teach industry best practices from day one. Show what "good" looks like.

### 4. Practical Focus

Emphasize "why" before "how". Connect concepts to real-world scenarios.

### 5. Comprehensive Validation

Every lesson includes validation checklists. Students verify their
understanding.

## 💡 Tips for Content Creation

1. **Start with Welcome and Setup** - These set expectations and ensure students
   can follow along
2. **Reference Real Companies** - Mention Facebook, Netflix, Airbnb to show
   React's importance
3. **Use Analogies** - Complex concepts become clear with good analogies
4. **Show Bad Examples** - Learn from mistakes section is highly valuable
5. **Link Everything** - Connect concepts across lessons for cohesive learning
6. **Think Portfolio** - Emphasize that TaskFlow Pro is a portfolio project
7. **Be Encouraging** - Learning React is challenging - encourage persistence
